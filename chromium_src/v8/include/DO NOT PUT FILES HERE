//brave/chromium_src/v8/include overrides don't work because all public v8
headers use local paths to reference nearby headers. Local headers will always
be preferred over any -I<path> flag.

To add something into v8 public interface use these options:
 1. Add new file into //brave/v8/include, create new functions that receive
    Isolate/Context/other class as a parameter, implement new API in
    //brave/chromium_src/v8/src/api.cc.
 2. Directly patch v8 file if this is really necessary (a struct extension or
    a function signature change).
