// Along with SyncUserSettings::KeepAccountSettingsPrefsOnlyForUsers_Unused
// makes this method do nothing.
// We need it on Android because Brave Browser doesn't use Google Account
// to run Brave Sync. Otherwise empty gaia_ids arrives to
// SyncTransportDataPrefs::KeepAccountSettingsPrefsOnlyForUsers, where
// "Clears all account-keyed preferences for all accounts that are NOT in
// `available_gaia_ids`." So all kSyncTransportDataPerAccount gets wiped.
// Then ValidateSyncTransportData at sync_engine_impl.cc fails and
// SyncEngineImpl::Initialize overwrites sync transport prefs. Device with new
// generated cache guid is sent to the chain and all other devices see the
// duplicated entry in addition to other possible mess.
// To avoid this, override with empty implementation.
