// Chromium uses `version_info::GetProductName()` to get the browser's "brand"
// name, but on MacOS we use different names for different channels (adding Beta
// or Nightly, for example). In the UA client hint, though, we want a consistent
// name regardless of the channel, so we just hard-code it. Note, that we use
// IDS_PRODUCT_NAME from app/chromium_strings.grd (brave_strings.grd) in
// constructing the UA in brave/browser/brave_content_browser_client.cc, but we
// can't use it here in the //components.
