///
/// By default, creating a `BlockieGroup` will result in a dynamically sized icon based
/// on the users size category. If you for some reason need to obtain a fixed size asset icon,
/// wrap this view in another frame of your desired size, for example:
///
///     BlockieGroup(fromAddress: "...", toAddress: "...")
///       .frame(width: 20, height: 20)
///
/// **Alignment**
///
/// You may want to set `alignVisuallyCentered` based on the usage of the `BlockieGroup`
///
/// A `BlockieGroup` will visually center the large `fromAddress` blockie creating extra
/// padding on the leading side unless `alignVisuallyCentered` is set to `false`. Set this
/// to `false` when you are displaying a `BlockieGroup` in a non-centere aligned container
/// such as when it will line up with the edge of its container. When a `BlockieGroup` appears
/// centered within a container ensure `alignVisuallyCentered` is set to `true`
