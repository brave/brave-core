    <h1>Test Ads</h1>
    
    <div>
      <div id="test-ad-aggressive">
        <img src="http://1st_party.localhost/image.gif">
        This element should be hidden (standard or aggressive mode) even though it's a 1st party ad.
        This is because it comes back as part of the aggressive selectors list.
        The aggressive selectors list are ones that come from 
        non-default and non-regional filter lists such as the cookie consent blocking list
        and are ignored when unhiding 1st party content on standard mode.
      </div>
      
      <div id="test-ad-1st-party">
        <img src="http://1st_party.localhost/image.gif">
        This element should be unhidden (after the pump) only on standard mode because it is a 1st party ad.
        Standard selectors are ones that come from the the default filter list or any regional filter lists.
        These can be unhidden on standard mode if they are 1st party ads.
      </div>
      
      <div id="test-ad-3rd-party">
        <img src="http://3rd_party.localhost/image.gif">
        This element should be always hidden (standard or aggressive mode) because it's a 3rd party ad.
      </div>
      
      <div id="test-ad-simple">
        Hide b/c little txt

    </div>

    <div>
      <div class="test-ads-primary-standard">
        The elements below all belong to the ".test-ads-primary-standard div" selector.
        This selector is returned as part of the standard selector list 
        which is given to the CF script during its initialization.
        Because they all share the same selector, 
        one unhidden means all are unhidden regardless of 1st or 3rd party.
        And as the first element is a 1st party ad, all are unhidden.
        Finally, because this selector is fed into the script right away,
        the unhiding doesn't need to wait for the pump.

        <div id="test-ad-primary-standard-1st-party">
          <img src="http://1st_party.localhost/image.gif">
          This element should be unhidden on standard mode because it is a 1st party ad.
          Because of this element. All of its div siblings will be unhidden because they all belong to the 
          .test-ads-primary-standard div selector.
        </div>

        <div id="test-ad-primary-standard-3rd-party">
          <img src="http://3rd_party.localhost/image.gif">
          Even though it's a 3rd party ad, this element should be unhidden on standard mode.
          This is because it belongs to the .test-ads-primary-standard div selector which is unhidden 
          due to the 1st party element above
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="test-ads-primary-aggressive">
        These div children below should be hidden because they belong to an aggressive selector
        regardless of mode or 1st/3rd party status.
        Because this selector is fed into the script right away, 
        the unhiding doesn't need to wait for the pump.
        
        <div id="test-ad-primary-aggressive-1st-party">
          <img src="http://1st_party.localhost/image.gif">
          This element should be hidden always regardless of aggressive or standard mode 
          because it is a div child of the .test-ads-primary-aggressive class
        </div>

        <div id="test-ad-primary-aggressive-3rd-party">
          <img src="http://3rd_party.localhost/image.gif">
