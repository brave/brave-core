Building the code
-----------------

1. Install the latest [Xcode developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from Apple. (Xcode 14.0 and up required).
1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools 
    ```shell
    xcode-select --install
    ```
1. Make sure `npm` is installed, `node` version 16 is recommended
1. Install SwiftLint (0.50.0 or higher):
    ```shell
    brew update
    brew install swiftlint
    ```
1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/brave/brave-ios.git
    ```
1. Pull in the project dependencies:
    ```shell
    cd brave-ios
    sh ./bootstrap.sh --ci
    ```
1. Add a symlink to `npm` (M1 Macs)
    ```shell
    sudo ln -s $(which npm) /usr/local/bin/npm
    sudo ln -s $(which node) /usr/local/bin/node
    ```
1. Open `App/Client.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
1. Build the `Debug` scheme in Xcode.

Working with BraveCore
----------------

Many features in iOS (sync, ads, wallet, etc.) are powered by shared code in [brave-core](https://github.com/brave/brave-core). Instructions on building and updating this code can be found [here](https://github.com/brave/brave-ios/blob/development/BraveCore/Working%20with%20BraveCore.md)

## Contributor guidelines

### Creating a pull request
* All pull requests must be associated with a specific GitHub issue.
* If a bug corresponding to the fix does not yet exist, please file it.
* Please use the following formats in your PR titles:
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Fix/Ref #<issueId>: <description>.`
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples:
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Fix #102: Added Face ID usage description to plist.`
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Ref #102: Fixed type on Face ID usage description.`
* Add any additional information regarding the PR in the description.
* In the unlikely and rare situation that a PR fixing multiple, related issues separate issue numbers with a comma:
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Fix #159, Fix #160: Removed whitepsace for + button on right-side panel.`
* PRs will be squashed and merged, so it is important to keep PRs focused on specific tasks.

### Swift style
* Swift code should generally follow the conventions listed at https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide.

### Whitespace
* New code should not contain any trailing whitespace.
* We recommend *enabling* the "Automatically trim trailing whitespace" and keeping "Including whitespace-only lines" *deselected* in Xcode (under Text Editing).

### Commits
* Each commit should have a single clear purpose. If a commit contains multiple unrelated changes, those changes should be split into separate commits.
* If a commit requires another commit to build properly, those commits should be squashed.
* Follow-up commits for any review comments should be squashed. Do not include "Fixed PR comments", merge commits, or other "temporary" commits in pull requests.

> In *most* cases Pull Request commits will remain intact with a merge commit on the targeted branch.

## Code Signing

1. After running the *bootstrap.sh* script in the setup instructions navigate to:
<br>`App/Configuration/Local/DevTeam.xcconfig`
1. Add your *Apple Team ID* in this file:
<br>`LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = KL8N8XSYF4`

>Team IDs look identical to provisioning profile UUIDs, so make sure this is the correct one.

The entire `Local` directory is included in the `.gitignore`, so these changes are not tracked by source control. This allows code signing without making tracked changes. Updating this file will only sign the `Debug` target for local builds.

### Finding Team IDs

The easiest known way to find your team ID is to log into your [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) account. After logging in, the team ID is currently shown at the end of the URL:
<br>`https://developer.apple.com/account/<TEAM ID>`

Use this string literal in the above, `DevTeam.xcconfig` file to code sign
