# This script has several convenience features when committing changes to
# brave-core.
#
# 1. Chromium upgrade branches automatically added as tags
#
#    Any branch that starts with "cr" and is followed by a number will be added
#    to the commit message as a tag (e.g. [cr100] Some change).
#
# 2. Tags can be passed in via the environment variable tags
#
#    For instance `tags=CodeHealth,canary git commit -m "Some change"` will
#    add [CodeHealth] and [canary] to the commit message.
#
# 3. Labels in the branch name behind '+' will be added as tags
#
#    This means that a branch `canary+fix-failure` will have [canary] added to
#    the commit message.
#
# 4. `culprit` environment variable for google source links
#
#    If the culprit environment variable is set, it will be used to add links to
#    the commit message. The culprit variable should be a comma-separated list
#    of commit hashes. The script will look up the commit messages for each hash
#    and add them to the commit message. The links will be in the format
#    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/{hash}.
#
# 5. `issue` environment variable for "Resolves" links
#
#    The `issue` environment variable can be set to a comma-separated list of
#    issue numbers. The script will add "Resolves" links at the end of the
#    commit message.
#
# 6. `fixup!` commits are ignored
#
#    If the commit message starts with "fixup!", the script will not add any
#    tags or links to the commit message.
#
# 7. Issue numbers in the branch name
#
#    If the branch name contains "issue-" followed by a number, the script will
#    add a "Resolves" link to the commit message. For example, if the branch
#    name is "codehealth+fix-issue-123", the commit message will include a link
#    to "Resolves https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/123".
#
# This script can be set up either as a commit-msg hook, or as a
# prepare-commit-msg hook. The difference is that the commit-msg hook will run
# after the commit message is created, while the prepare-commit-msg hook will
# run before the commit message is created, which allows you to inspect the
# insertions.
#
# To install this script as a commit-msg hook, run the following command:
#   cp tools/cr/commit-msg.py .git/hooks/commit-msg
