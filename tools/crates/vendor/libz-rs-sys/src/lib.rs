//! # Safety
//!
//! Most of the functions in this module are `unsafe fn`s, meaning that their behavior may be
//! undefined if certain assumptions are broken by the caller. In most cases, documentation
//! in this module refers to the safety assumptions of standard library functions.
//!
//! In most cases, pointers must be either `NULL` or satisfy the requirements of `&*ptr` or `&mut
//! *ptr`. This requirement maps to the requirements of [`pointer::as_ref`] and [`pointer::as_mut`]
//! for immutable and mutable pointers respectively.
//!
//! For pointer and length pairs, describing some sequence of elements in memory, the requirements
//! of [`core::slice::from_raw_parts`] or [`core::slice::from_raw_parts_mut`] apply. In some cases,
//! the element type `T` is converted into `MaybeUninit<T>`, meaning that while the slice must be
//! valid, the elements in the slice can be uninitialized. Using uninitialized buffers for output
//! is more performant.
//!
//! Finally, some functions accept a string argument, which must either be `NULL` or satisfy the
//! requirements of [`core::ffi::CStr::from_ptr`].
//!
//! [`pointer::as_ref`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/primitive.pointer.html#method.as_ref
//! [`pointer::as_mut`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/primitive.pointer.html#method.as_mut
