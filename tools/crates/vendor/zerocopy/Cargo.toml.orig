# These key/value pairs are parsed by `build.rs`. Each entry names a `--cfg`
# which will be emitted if zerocopy is built with a toolchain version *lower*
# than the specified version. In the emitted `--cfg`, dashes are replaced by
# underscores.
#
# Each name is suffixed with the version it corresponds to. This is a convention
# used in the codebase to make it less likely for us to make mistakes when
# writing `doc_cfg` attributes.
