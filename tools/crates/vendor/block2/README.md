Apple's C language extension of blocks in Rust.

This crate provides functionality for interacting with C blocks, which is the
C-equivalent of Rust's closures.

They are _technically_ not limited to only being used in Objective-C, though
in practice it's likely the only place you'll ever encounter them.

See [the docs](https://docs.rs/block2/) for a more thorough overview.

This crate is part of the [`objc2` project](https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2),
