/*!
Support for "printf"-style parsing and formatting.

While the routines exposed in this module very closely resemble the
corresponding [`strptime`] and [`strftime`] POSIX functions, it is not a goal
for the formatting machinery to precisely match POSIX semantics.

If there is a conversion specifier you need that Jiff doesn't support, please
[create a new issue][create-issue].

The formatting and parsing in this module does not currently support any
form of localization. Please see [this issue][locale] about the topic of
localization in Jiff.

# Example

This shows how to parse a civil date and its weekday:

```
use jiff::civil::Date;

let date = Date::strptime("%Y-%m-%d is a %A", "2024-07-15 is a Monday")?;
assert_eq!(date.to_string(), "2024-07-15");
// Leading zeros are optional for numbers in all cases:
let date = Date::strptime("%Y-%m-%d is a %A", "2024-07-15 is a Monday")?;
assert_eq!(date.to_string(), "2024-07-15");
// Parsing does error checking! 2024-07-15 was not a Tuesday.
assert!(Date::strptime("%Y-%m-%d is a %A", "2024-07-15 is a Tuesday").is_err());

# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

And this shows how to format a zoned datetime with a time zone abbreviation:

```
use jiff::civil::date;

let zdt = date(2024, 7, 15).at(17, 30, 59, 0).in_tz("Australia/Tasmania")?;
// %-I instead of %I means no padding.
let string = zdt.strftime("%A, %B %d, %Y at %-I:%M%P %Z").to_string();
assert_eq!(string, "Monday, July 15, 2024 at 5:30pm AEST");

# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

Or parse a zoned datetime with an IANA time zone identifier:

```
use jiff::{civil::date, Zoned};

let zdt = Zoned::strptime(
    "%A, %B %d, %Y at %-I:%M%P %:Q",
    "Monday, July 15, 2024 at 5:30pm Australia/Tasmania",
)?;
assert_eq!(
    zdt,
    date(2024, 7, 15).at(17, 30, 0, 0).in_tz("Australia/Tasmania")?,
);

# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

# Usage

For most cases, you can use the `strptime` and `strftime` methods on the
corresponding datetime type. For example, [`Zoned::strptime`] and
[`Zoned::strftime`]. However, the [`BrokenDownTime`] type in this module
provides a little more control.

For example, assuming `t` is a `civil::Time`, then
`t.strftime("%Y").to_string()` will actually panic because a `civil::Time` does
not have a year. While the underlying formatting machinery actually returns
an error, this error gets turned into a panic by virtue of going through the
`std::fmt::Display` and `std::string::ToString` APIs.

In contrast, [`BrokenDownTime::format`] (or just [`format`](format())) can
report the error to you without any panicking:

```
use jiff::{civil::time, fmt::strtime};

let t = time(23, 59, 59, 0);
assert_eq!(
    strtime::format("%Y", t).unwrap_err().to_string(),
    "strftime formatting failed: %Y failed: requires date to format year",
);
```

# Advice

The formatting machinery supported by this module is not especially expressive.
The pattern language is a simple sequence of conversion specifiers interspersed
by literals and arbitrary whitespace. This means that you sometimes need
delimiters or spaces between components. For example, this is fine:

```
use jiff::fmt::strtime;

let date = strtime::parse("%Y%m%d", "20240715")?.to_date()?;
assert_eq!(date.to_string(), "2024-07-15");
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

But this is ambiguous (is the year `999` or `9990`?):

```
use jiff::fmt::strtime;

assert!(strtime::parse("%Y%m%d", "9990715").is_err());
```

In this case, since years greedily consume up to 4 digits by default, `9990`
is parsed as the year. And since months greedily consume up to 2 digits by
default, `71` is parsed as the month, which results in an invalid day. If you
expect your datetimes to always use 4 digits for the year, then it might be
okay to skip on the delimiters. For example, the year `999` could be written
with a leading zero:

```
use jiff::fmt::strtime;

let date = strtime::parse("%Y%m%d", "09990715")?.to_date()?;
assert_eq!(date.to_string(), "0999-07-15");
// Indeed, the leading zero is written by default when
// formatting, since years are padded out to 4 digits
// by default:
assert_eq!(date.strftime("%Y%m%d").to_string(), "09990715");

# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

The main advice here is that these APIs can come in handy for ad hoc tasks that
would otherwise be annoying to deal with. For example, I once wrote a tool to
extract data from an XML dump of my SMS messages, and one of the date formats
used was `Apr 1, 2022 20:46:15`. That doesn't correspond to any standard, and
while parsing it with a regex isn't that difficult, it's pretty annoying,
especially because of the English abbreviated month name. That's exactly the
kind of use case where this module shines.

If the formatting machinery in this module isn't flexible enough for your use
case and you don't control the format, it is recommended to write a bespoke
parser (possibly with regex). It is unlikely that the expressiveness of this
formatting machinery will be improved much. (Although it is plausible to add
new conversion specifiers.)

# Conversion specifications

This table lists the complete set of conversion specifiers supported in the
format. While most conversion specifiers are supported as is in both parsing
and formatting, there are some differences. Where differences occur, they are
noted in the table below.

When parsing, and whenever a conversion specifier matches an enumeration of
strings, the strings are matched without regard to ASCII case.

| Specifier | Example | Description |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `%%` | `%%` | A literal `%`. |
| `%A`, `%a` | `Sunday`, `Sun` | The full and abbreviated weekday, respectively. |
| `%B`, `%b`, `%h` | `June`, `Jun`, `Jun` | The full and abbreviated month name, respectively. |
| `%C` | `20` | The century of the year. No padding. |
| `%D` | `7/14/24` | Equivalent to `%m/%d/%y`. |
| `%d`, `%e` | `25`, ` 5` | The day of the month. `%d` is zero-padded, `%e` is space padded. |
| `%F` | `2024-07-14` | Equivalent to `%Y-%m-%d`. |
| `%f` | `000456` | Fractional seconds, up to nanosecond precision. |
| `%.f` | `.000456` | Optional fractional seconds, with dot, up to nanosecond precision. |
| `%G` | `2024` | An [ISO 8601 week-based] year. Zero padded to 4 digits. |
| `%g` | `24` | A two-digit [ISO 8601 week-based] year. Represents only 1969-2068. Zero padded. |
| `%H` | `23` | The hour in a 24 hour clock. Zero padded. |
| `%I` | `11` | The hour in a 12 hour clock. Zero padded. |
| `%j` | `060` | The day of the year. Range is `1..=366`. Zero padded to 3 digits. |
| `%k` | `15` | The hour in a 24 hour clock. Space padded. |
| `%l` | ` 3` | The hour in a 12 hour clock. Space padded. |
| `%M` | `04` | The minute. Zero padded. |
| `%m` | `01` | The month. Zero padded. |
| `%n` | `\n` | Formats as a newline character. Parses arbitrary whitespace. |
| `%P` | `am` | Whether the time is in the AM or PM, lowercase. |
| `%p` | `PM` | Whether the time is in the AM or PM, uppercase. |
| `%Q` | `America/New_York`, `+0530` | An IANA time zone identifier, or `%z` if one doesn't exist. |
| `%:Q` | `America/New_York`, `+05:30` | An IANA time zone identifier, or `%:z` if one doesn't exist. |
| `%R` | `23:30` | Equivalent to `%H:%M`. |
| `%S` | `59` | The second. Zero padded. |
| `%s` | `1737396540` | A Unix timestamp, in seconds. |
| `%T` | `23:30:59` | Equivalent to `%H:%M:%S`. |
| `%t` | `\t` | Formats as a tab character. Parses arbitrary whitespace. |
| `%U` | `03` | Week number. Week 1 is the first week starting with a Sunday. Zero padded. |
| `%u` | `7` | The day of the week beginning with Monday at `1`. |
| `%W` | `03` | Week number. Week 1 is the first week starting with a Monday. Zero padded. |
| `%w` | `0` | The day of the week beginning with Sunday at `0`. |
| `%Y` | `2024` | A full year, including century. Zero padded to 4 digits. |
| `%y` | `24` | A two-digit year. Represents only 1969-2068. Zero padded. |
| `%Z` | `EDT` | A time zone abbreviation. Supported when formatting only. |
| `%z` | `+0530` | A time zone offset in the format `[+-]HHMM[SS]`. |
| `%:z` | `+05:30` | A time zone offset in the format `[+-]HH:MM[:SS]`. |

The following specifiers are deprecated. Specifically, in `jiff 0.2`, `%V` will
parse or print the ISO 8601 week number and `%:V` will no longer be recognized.
To emit an IANA time zone identifier (which is what `%V` does in `jiff 0.1`)
in a forward compatible way, please use the `%Q` or `%:Q` specifier (as listed
above).

| Specifier | Example | Description |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `%V` | `America/New_York`, `+0530` | An IANA time zone identifier, or `%z` if one doesn't exist. |
| `%:V` | `America/New_York`, `+05:30` | An IANA time zone identifier, or `%:z` if one doesn't exist. |

When formatting, the following flags can be inserted immediately after the `%`
and before the directive:

* `_` - Pad a numeric result to the left with spaces.
* `-` - Do not pad a numeric result.
* `0` - Pad a numeric result to the left with zeros.
* `^` - Use alphabetic uppercase for all relevant strings.
* `#` - Swap the case of the result string. This is typically only useful with
`%p` or `%Z`, since they are the only conversion specifiers that emit strings
entirely in uppercase by default.

The above flags override the "default" settings of a specifier. For example,
`%_d` pads with spaces instead of zeros, and `%0e` pads with zeros instead of
spaces. The exceptions are the `%z` and `%:z` specifiers. They are unaffected
by any flags.

Moreover, any number of decimal digits can be inserted after the (possibly
absent) flag and before the directive, so long as the parsed number is less
than 256. The number formed by these digits will correspond to the minimum
amount of padding (to the left).

The flags and padding amount above may be used when parsing as well. Most
settings are ignored during parsing except for padding. For example, if one
wanted to parse `003` as the day `3`, then one should use `%03d`. Otherwise, by
default, `%d` will only try to consume at most 2 digits.

The `%f` and `%.f` flags also support specifying the precision, up to
nanoseconds. For example, `%3f` and `%.3f` will both always print a fractional
second component to exactly 3 decimal places. When no precision is specified,
then `%f` will always emit at least one digit, even if it's zero. But `%.f`
will emit the empty string when the fractional component is zero. Otherwise, it
will include the leading `.`. For parsing, `%f` does not include the leading
dot, but `%.f` does. Note that all of the options above are still parsed for
`%f` and `%.f`, but they are all no-ops (except for the padding for `%f`, which
is instead interpreted as a precision setting). When using a precision setting,
truncation is used. If you need a different rounding mode, you should use
higher level APIs like [`Timestamp::round`] or [`Zoned::round`].

# Conditionally unsupported

Jiff does not support `%Q` or `%:Q` (IANA time zone identifier) when the
`alloc` crate feature is not enabled. This is because a time zone identifier
is variable width data. If you have a use case for this, please
[detail it in a new issue](https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/new).

# Unsupported

The following things are currently unsupported:

* Parsing or formatting fractional seconds in the time time zone offset.
* A conversion specifier for an ISO 8601 week number. It is planned to support
  this, via `%V`, in `jiff 0.2`.
* Locale oriented conversion specifiers, such as `%c`, `%r` and `%+`, are not
  supported by Jiff. For locale oriented datetime formatting, please use the
  [`icu`] crate.

///
/// Otherwise, typical use of this module happens indirectly via APIs like
/// [`Zoned::strptime`] and [`Zoned::strftime`].
///
/// # Design
///
/// This is the type that parsing writes to and formatting reads from. That
/// is, parsing proceeds by writing individual parsed fields to this type, and
/// then converting the fields to datetime types like [`Zoned`] only after
/// parsing is complete. Similarly, formatting always begins by converting
/// datetime types like `Zoned` into a `BrokenDownTime`, and then formatting
/// the individual fields from there.
// Design:
//
// This is meant to be very similar to libc's `struct tm` in that it
// represents civil time, although may have an offset attached to it, in which
// case it represents an absolute time. The main difference is that each field
// is explicitly optional, where as in C, there's no way to tell whether a
// field is "set" or not. In C, this isn't so much a problem, because the
// caller needs to explicitly pass in a pointer to a `struct tm`, and so the
// API makes it clear that it's going to mutate the time.
//
// But in Rust, we really just want to accept a format string, an input and
// return a fresh datetime. (Nevermind the fact that we don't provide a way
// to mutate datetimes in place.) We could just use "default" units like you
// might in C, but it would be very surprising if `%m-%d` just decided to fill
// in the year for you with some default value. So we track which pieces have
// been set individually and return errors when requesting, e.g., a `Date`
// when no `year` has been parsed.
//
// We do permit time units to be filled in by default, as-is consistent with
// the rest of Jiff's API. e.g., If a `DateTime` is requested but the format
// string has no directives for time, we'll happy default to midnight. The
// only catch is that you can't omit time units bigger than any present time
// unit. For example, only `%M` doesn't fly. If you want to parse minutes, you
// also have to parse hours.
//
// This design does also let us possibly do "incomplete" parsing by asking
// the caller for a datetime to "seed" a `Fields` struct, and then execute
// parsing. But Jiff doesn't currently expose an API to do that. But this
// implementation was intentionally designed to support that use case, C
// style, if it comes up.

/// A "lazy" implementation of `std::fmt::Display` for `strftime`.
///
/// Values of this type are created by the `strftime` methods on the various
/// datetime types in this crate. For example, [`Zoned::strftime`].
///
/// A `Display` captures the information needed from the datetime and waits to
/// do the actual formatting when this type's `std::fmt::Display` trait
/// implementation is actually used.
///
/// # Errors and panics
///
/// This trait implementation returns an error when the underlying formatting
/// can fail. Formatting can fail either because of an invalid format string,
/// or if formatting requires a field in `BrokenDownTime` to be set that isn't.
/// For example, trying to format a [`DateTime`] with the `%z` specifier will
/// fail because a `DateTime` has no time zone or offset information associated
/// with it.
///
/// Note though that the `std::fmt::Display` API doesn't support surfacing
/// arbitrary errors. All errors collapse into the unit `std::fmt::Error`
/// struct. To see the actual error, use [`BrokenDownTime::format`],
/// [`BrokenDownTime::to_string`] or [`strtime::format`](format()).
/// Unfortunately, the `std::fmt::Display` trait is used in many places where
/// there is no way to report errors other than panicking.
///
/// Therefore, only use this type if you know your formatting string is valid
/// and that the datetime type being formatted has all of the information
/// required by the format string. For most conversion specifiers, this falls
/// in the category of things where "if it works, it works for all inputs."
/// Unfortunately, there are some exceptions to this. For example, the `%y`
/// modifier will only format a year if it falls in the range `1969-2068` and
/// will otherwise return an error.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows how to format a zoned datetime using
/// [`Zoned::strftime`]:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, fmt::strtime, tz};
///
/// let zdt = date(2024, 7, 15).at(16, 24, 59, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// let string = zdt.strftime("%a, %-d %b %Y %T %z").to_string();
/// assert_eq!(string, "Mon, 15 Jul 2024 16:24:59 -0400");
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())

///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, fmt::strtime, tz};
///
/// let zdt = date(2024, 7, 15).at(16, 24, 59, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
