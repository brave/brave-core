/// A time zone aware instant in time.
///
/// A `Zoned` value can be thought of as the combination of following types,
/// all rolled into one:
///
/// * A [`Timestamp`] for indicating the precise instant in time.
/// * A [`DateTime`] for indicating the "civil" calendar date and clock time.
/// * A [`TimeZone`] for indicating how to apply time zone transitions while
/// performing arithmetic.
///
/// In particular, a `Zoned` is specifically designed for dealing with
/// datetimes in a time zone aware manner. Here are some highlights:
///
/// * Arithmetic automatically adjusts for daylight saving time (DST), using
/// the rules defined by [RFC 5545].
/// * Creating new `Zoned` values from other `Zoned` values via [`Zoned::with`]
/// by changing clock time (e.g., `02:30`) can do so without worrying that the
/// time will be invalid due to DST transitions.
/// * An approximate superset of the [`DateTime`] API is offered on `Zoned`,
/// but where each of its operations take time zone into account when
/// appropriate. For example, [`DateTime::start_of_day`] always returns a
/// datetime set to midnight, but [`Zoned::start_of_day`] returns the first
/// instant of a day, which might not be midnight if there is a time zone
/// transition at midnight.
/// * When using a `Zoned`, it is easy to switch between civil datetime (the
/// day you see on the calendar and the time you see on the clock) and Unix
/// time (a precise instant in time). Indeed, a `Zoned` can be losslessy
/// converted to any other datetime type in this crate: [`Timestamp`],
/// [`DateTime`], [`Date`] and [`Time`].
/// * A `Zoned` value can be losslessly serialized and deserialized, via
/// [serde], by adhering to [RFC 8536]. An example of a serialized zoned
/// datetime is `2024-07-04T08:39:00-04:00[America/New_York]`.
/// * Since a `Zoned` stores a [`TimeZone`] itself, multiple time zone aware
/// operations can be chained together without repeatedly specifying the time
/// zone.
///

/// # Parsing and printing
///
/// The `Zoned` type provides convenient trait implementations of
/// [`std::str::FromStr`] and [`std::fmt::Display`]:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::Zoned;
///
/// let zdt: Zoned = "2024-06-19 15:22[America/New_York]".parse()?;
/// // Notice that the second component and the offset have both been added.
/// assert_eq!(zdt.to_string(), "2024-06-19T15:22:00-04:00[America/New_York]");
///
/// // While in the above case the datetime is unambiguous, in some cases, it
/// // can be ambiguous. In these cases, an offset is required to correctly
/// // roundtrip a zoned datetime. For example, on 2024-11-03 in New York, the
/// // 1 o'clock hour was repeated twice, corresponding to the end of daylight
/// // saving time.
/// //
/// // So because of the ambiguity, this time could be in offset -04 (the first
/// // time 1 o'clock is on the clock) or it could be -05 (the second time
/// // 1 o'clock is on the clock, corresponding to the end of DST).
/// //
/// // By default, parsing uses a "compatible" strategy for resolving all cases
/// // of ambiguity: in forward transitions (gaps), the later time is selected.
/// // And in backward transitions (folds), the earlier time is selected.
/// let zdt: Zoned = "2024-11-03 01:30[America/New_York]".parse()?;
/// // As we can see, since this was a fold, the earlier time was selected
/// // because the -04 offset is the first time 1 o'clock appears on the clock.
/// assert_eq!(zdt.to_string(), "2024-11-03T01:30:00-04:00[America/New_York]");
/// // But if we changed the offset and re-serialized, the only thing that
/// // changes is, indeed, the offset. This demonstrates that the offset is
/// // key to ensuring lossless serialization.
/// let zdt = zdt.with().offset(jiff::tz::offset(-5)).build()?;
/// assert_eq!(zdt.to_string(), "2024-11-03T01:30:00-05:00[America/New_York]");
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// A `Zoned` can also be parsed from just a time zone aware date (but the
/// time zone annotation is still required). In this case, the time is set to
/// midnight:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::Zoned;
///
/// let zdt: Zoned = "2024-06-19[America/New_York]".parse()?;
/// assert_eq!(zdt.to_string(), "2024-06-19T00:00:00-04:00[America/New_York]");
/// // ... although it isn't always midnight, in the case of a time zone
/// // transition at midnight!
/// let zdt: Zoned = "2015-10-18[America/Sao_Paulo]".parse()?;
/// assert_eq!(zdt.to_string(), "2015-10-18T01:00:00-02:00[America/Sao_Paulo]");

/// ```
///
/// For more information on the specific format supported, see the
/// [`fmt::temporal`](crate::fmt::temporal) module documentation.
///
/// # Leap seconds
///
/// Jiff does not support leap seconds. Jiff behaves as if they don't exist.
/// The only exception is that if one parses a datetime with a second component
/// of `60`, then it is automatically constrained to `59`:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, Zoned};
///
/// let zdt: Zoned = "2016-12-31 23:59:60[Australia/Tasmania]".parse()?;

///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Comparisons
///
/// The `Zoned` type provides both `Eq` and `Ord` trait implementations to
/// facilitate easy comparisons. When a zoned datetime `zdt1` occurs before a
/// zoned datetime `zdt2`, then `zdt1 < zdt2`. For example:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::date;
///
/// let zdt1 = date(2024, 3, 11).at(1, 25, 15, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// let zdt2 = date(2025, 1, 31).at(0, 30, 0, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// assert!(zdt1 < zdt2);
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// Note that `Zoned` comparisons only consider the precise instant in time.
/// The civil datetime or even the time zone are completely ignored. So it's
/// possible for a zoned datetime to be less than another even if it's civil
/// datetime is bigger:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::date;
///
/// let zdt1 = date(2024, 7, 4).at(12, 0, 0, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// let zdt2 = date(2024, 7, 4).at(11, 0, 0, 0).in_tz("America/Los_Angeles")?;
/// assert!(zdt1 < zdt2);
/// // But if we only compare civil datetime, the result is flipped:
/// assert!(zdt1.datetime() > zdt2.datetime());
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// The same applies for equality as well. Two `Zoned` values are equal, even
/// if they have different time zones, when the instant in time is identical:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::date;
///
/// let zdt1 = date(2024, 7, 4).at(12, 0, 0, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// let zdt2 = date(2024, 7, 4).at(9, 0, 0, 0).in_tz("America/Los_Angeles")?;
/// assert_eq!(zdt1, zdt2);
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// (Note that this is different from
/// [Temporal's `ZonedDateTime.equals`][temporal-equals] comparison, which will
/// take time zone into account for equality. This is because `Eq` and `Ord`
/// trait implementations must be consistent in Rust. If you need Temporal's
/// behavior, then use `zdt1 == zdt2 && zdt1.time_zone() == zdt2.time_zone()`.)
///
/// [temporal-equals]: https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/zoneddatetime.html#equals
///
/// # Arithmetic
///
/// This type provides routines for adding and subtracting spans of time, as
/// well as computing the span of time between two `Zoned` values. These
/// operations take time zones into account.
///
/// For adding or subtracting spans of time, one can use any of the following
/// routines:
///
/// * [`Zoned::checked_add`] or [`Zoned::checked_sub`] for checked
/// arithmetic.
/// * [`Zoned::saturating_add`] or [`Zoned::saturating_sub`] for
/// saturating arithmetic.
///
/// Additionally, checked arithmetic is available via the `Add` and `Sub`
/// trait implementations. When the result overflows, a panic occurs.
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, ToSpan};
///
/// let start = date(2024, 2, 25).at(15, 45, 0, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// // `Zoned` doesn't implement `Copy`, so you'll want to use `&start` instead
/// // of `start` if you want to keep using it after arithmetic.
/// let one_week_later = start + 1.weeks();
/// assert_eq!(one_week_later.datetime(), date(2024, 3, 3).at(15, 45, 0, 0));
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// One can compute the span of time between two zoned datetimes using either
/// [`Zoned::until`] or [`Zoned::since`]. It's also possible to subtract
/// two `Zoned` values directly via a `Sub` trait implementation:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, ToSpan};
///
/// let zdt1 = date(2024, 5, 3).at(23, 30, 0, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// let zdt2 = date(2024, 2, 25).at(7, 0, 0, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// assert_eq!(zdt1 - zdt2, 1647.hours().minutes(30).fieldwise());
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// The `until` and `since` APIs are polymorphic and allow re-balancing and
/// rounding the span returned. For example, the default largest unit is hours
/// (as exemplified above), but we can ask for bigger units:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, ToSpan, Unit};
///
/// let zdt1 = date(2024, 5, 3).at(23, 30, 0, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// let zdt2 = date(2024, 2, 25).at(7, 0, 0, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// assert_eq!(
///     zdt1.since((Unit::Year, &zdt2))?,
///     2.months().days(7).hours(16).minutes(30).fieldwise(),
/// );
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// Or even round the span returned:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, RoundMode, ToSpan, Unit, ZonedDifference};
///
/// let zdt1 = date(2024, 5, 3).at(23, 30, 0, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;

///             .largest(Unit::Year),
///     )?,
///     2.months().days(7).fieldwise(),

/// // `ZonedDifference` uses truncation as a rounding mode by default,

///         ZonedDifference::new(&zdt2)

///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())

/// The representation of a `Zoned`.
///
/// This uses 4 different things: a timestamp, a datetime, an offset and a
/// time zone. This in turn makes `Zoned` a bit beefy (40 bytes on x86-64),
/// but I think this is probably the right trade off. (At time of writing,
/// 2024-07-04.)
///
/// Technically speaking, the only essential fields here are timestamp and time
/// zone. The datetime and offset can both be unambiguously _computed_ from the
/// combination of a timestamp and a time zone. Indeed, just the timestamp and
/// the time zone was my initial representation. But as I developed the API of
/// this type, it became clearer that we should probably store the datetime and
/// offset as well.
///
/// The main issue here is that in order to compute the datetime from a
/// timestamp and a time zone, you need to do two things:
///
/// 1. First, compute the offset. This means doing a binary search on the TZif
/// data for the transition (or closest transition) matching the timestamp.
/// 2. Second, use the offset (from UTC) to convert the timestamp into a civil
/// datetime. This involves a "Unix time to Unix epoch days" conversion that
/// requires some heavy arithmetic.
///
/// So if we don't store the datetime or offset, then we need to compute them
/// any time we need them. And the Temporal design really pushes heavily in
/// favor of treating the "instant in time" and "civil datetime" as two sides
/// to the same coin. That means users are very encouraged to just use whatever
/// they need. So if we are always computing the offset and datetime whenever
/// we need them, we're potentially punishing users for working with civil
/// datetimes. It just doesn't feel like the right trade-off.
///
/// Instead, my idea here is that, ultimately, `Zoned` is meant to provide
/// a one-stop shop for "doing the right thing." Presenting that unified
/// abstraction comes with costs. And that if we want to expose cheaper ways
/// of performing at least some of the operations on `Zoned` by making fewer
/// assumptions, then we should probably endeavor to do that by exposing a
/// lower level API. I'm not sure what that would look like, so I think it
/// should be driven by use cases.
///
/// Some other things I considered:
///
/// * Use `Zoned(Arc<ZonedInner>)` to make `Zoned` pointer-sized. But I didn't
/// like this because it implies creating any new `Zoned` value requires an
/// allocation. Since a `TimeZone` internally uses an `Arc`, all it requires
/// today is a chunky memcpy and an atomic ref count increment.
/// * Use `OnceLock` shenanigans for the datetime and offset fields. This would
/// make `Zoned` even beefier and I wasn't totally clear how much this would
/// save us. And it would impose some (probably small) cost on every datetime
/// or offset access.
/// * Use a radically different design that permits a `Zoned` to be `Copy`.
/// I personally find it deeply annoying that `Zoned` is both the "main"
/// datetime type in Jiff and also the only one that doesn't implement `Copy`.
/// I explored some designs, but I couldn't figure out how to make it work in
/// a satisfying way. The main issue here is `TimeZone`. A `TimeZone` is a huge
/// chunk of data and the ergonomics of the `Zoned` API require being able to
/// access a `TimeZone` without the caller providing it explicitly. So to me,
/// the only real alternative here is to use some kind of integer handle into
/// a global time zone database. But now you all of a sudden need to worry
/// about synchronization for every time zone access and plausibly also garbage
/// collection. And this also complicates matters for using custom time zone
/// databases. So I ultimately came down on "Zoned is not Copy" as the least
/// awful choice. *heavy sigh*

/// that should be present on the span returned. By default, the largest units
/// are days. Using this trait implementation is equivalent to
/// `ZonedDifference::new(&zdt).largest(unit)`.
///
/// One can also provide a `ZonedDifference` value directly. Doing so
/// is necessary to use the rounding features of calculating a span. For
/// example, setting the smallest unit (defaults to [`Unit::Nanosecond`]), the
/// rounding mode (defaults to [`RoundMode::Trunc`]) and the rounding increment
/// (defaults to `1`). The defaults are selected such that no rounding occurs.
///
/// Rounding a span as part of calculating it is provided as a convenience.
/// Callers may choose to round the span as a distinct step via
/// [`Span::round`], but callers may need to provide a reference date
/// for rounding larger units. By coupling rounding with routines like
/// [`Zoned::since`], the reference date can be set automatically based on
/// the input to `Zoned::since`.

/// therefore make calling `Zoned::round` in some common cases more
/// ergonomic:
///
/// * `From<Unit> for ZonedRound` will construct a rounding
/// configuration that rounds to the unit given. Specifically,
/// `ZonedRound::new().smallest(unit)`.
/// * `From<(Unit, i64)> for ZonedRound` is like the one above, but also
/// specifies the rounding increment for [`ZonedRound::increment`].
///
/// Note that in the default configuration, no rounding occurs.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows how to round a zoned datetime to the nearest second:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, Unit, Zoned};
///
/// let zdt: Zoned = "2024-06-20 16:24:59.5[America/New_York]".parse()?;

/// if you had a date of `2024-10-31T00:00:00[America/New_York]` and wanted

/// independent of the other, you would need to be careful to set the day first
/// and then the month. In some cases, you would need to set the month first
/// and then the day!
///
/// But with the builder, you can set values in any order:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::date;
///
/// let zdt1 = date(2024, 10, 31).at(0, 0, 0, 0).in_tz("America/New_York")?;
