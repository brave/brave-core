/// A representation of a civil date in the Gregorian calendar.
///
/// A `Date` value corresponds to a triple of year, month and day. Every `Date`
/// value is guaranteed to be a valid Gregorian calendar date. For example,
/// both `2023-02-29` and `2023-11-31` are invalid and cannot be represented by
/// a `Date`.
///
/// # Civil dates
///
/// A `Date` value behaves without regard to daylight saving time or time
/// zones in general. When doing arithmetic on dates with spans defined in
/// units of time (such as with [`Date::checked_add`]), days are considered to
/// always be precisely `86,400` seconds long.
///
/// # Parsing and printing
///
/// The `Date` type provides convenient trait implementations of
/// [`std::str::FromStr`] and [`std::fmt::Display`]:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::Date;
///
/// let date: Date = "2024-06-19".parse()?;
/// assert_eq!(date.to_string(), "2024-06-19");
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// A civil `Date` can also be parsed from something that _contains_ a date,
/// but with perhaps other data (such as an offset or time zone):
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::Date;
///
/// let date: Date = "2024-06-19T15:22:45-04[America/New_York]".parse()?;
/// assert_eq!(date.to_string(), "2024-06-19");
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// For more information on the specific format supported, see the
/// [`fmt::temporal`](crate::fmt::temporal) module documentation.
///
/// # Default value
///
/// For convenience, this type implements the `Default` trait. Its default
/// value corresponds to `0000-01-01`. One can also access this value via the
/// `Date::ZERO` constant.
///
/// # Comparisons
///
/// The `Date` type provides both `Eq` and `Ord` trait implementations to
/// facilitate easy comparisons. When a date `d1` occurs before a date `d2`,
/// then `d1 < d2`. For example:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::date;
///
/// let d1 = date(2024, 3, 11);
/// let d2 = date(2025, 1, 31);
/// assert!(d1 < d2);
/// ```
///
/// # Arithmetic
///
/// This type provides routines for adding and subtracting spans of time, as
/// well as computing the span of time between two `Date` values.
///
/// For adding or subtracting spans of time, one can use any of the following
/// routines:
///
/// * [`Date::checked_add`] or [`Date::checked_sub`] for checked arithmetic.
/// * [`Date::saturating_add`] or [`Date::saturating_sub`] for saturating
/// arithmetic.
///
/// Additionally, checked arithmetic is available via the `Add` and `Sub`
/// trait implementations. When the result overflows, a panic occurs.
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, ToSpan};
///
/// let start = date(2024, 2, 25);
/// let one_week_later = start + 1.weeks();
/// assert_eq!(one_week_later, date(2024, 3, 3));
/// ```
///
/// One can compute the span of time between two dates using either
/// [`Date::until`] or [`Date::since`]. It's also possible to subtract two
/// `Date` values directly via a `Sub` trait implementation:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, ToSpan};
///
/// let date1 = date(2024, 3, 3);
/// let date2 = date(2024, 2, 25);
/// assert_eq!(date1 - date2, 7.days().fieldwise());
/// ```
///
/// The `until` and `since` APIs are polymorphic and allow re-balancing and
/// rounding the span returned. For example, the default largest unit is days
/// (as exemplified above), but we can ask for bigger units:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, ToSpan, Unit};
///
/// let date1 = date(2024, 5, 3);
/// let date2 = date(2024, 2, 25);
/// assert_eq!(
///     date1.since((Unit::Year, date2))?,
///     2.months().days(7).fieldwise(),
/// );
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// Or even round the span returned:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::{DateDifference, date}, RoundMode, ToSpan, Unit};
///
/// let date1 = date(2024, 5, 15);
/// let date2 = date(2024, 2, 25);
/// assert_eq!(
///     date1.since(
///         DateDifference::new(date2)
///             .smallest(Unit::Month)
///             .largest(Unit::Year),
///     )?,
///     2.months().fieldwise(),
/// );
/// // `DateDifference` uses truncation as a rounding mode by default,
/// // but you can set the rounding mode to break ties away from zero:
/// assert_eq!(
///     date1.since(
///         DateDifference::new(date2)
///             .smallest(Unit::Month)
///             .largest(Unit::Year)
///             .mode(RoundMode::HalfExpand),
///     )?,
///     // Rounds up to 8 days.
///     3.months().fieldwise(),
/// );
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```

/// * `From<DateTime> for DateDifference` will construct a configuration
/// consisting of just the date from the given datetime. So for example,
/// `date.since(datetime)` returns the span from `datetime.date()` to `date`.
/// * `From<(Unit, Date)>` is a convenient way to specify the largest units
/// that should be present on the span returned. By default, the largest units
/// are days. Using this trait implementation is equivalent to
/// `DateDifference::new(date).largest(unit)`.
/// * `From<(Unit, DateTime)>` is like the one above, but with the date from
/// the given datetime.
///
/// One can also provide a `DateDifference` value directly. Doing so is
/// necessary to use the rounding features of calculating a span. For example,
/// setting the smallest unit (defaults to [`Unit::Day`]), the rounding mode
/// (defaults to [`RoundMode::Trunc`]) and the rounding increment (defaults to
/// `1`). The defaults are selected such that no rounding occurs.
///
/// Rounding a span as part of calculating it is provided as a convenience.
/// Callers may choose to round the span as a distinct step via
/// [`Span::round`], but callers may need to provide a reference date
/// for rounding larger units. By coupling rounding with routines like
/// [`Date::since`], the reference date can be set automatically based on
/// the input to `Date::since`.
