/// # API design
///
/// A `SignedDuration` is, as much as is possible, a replica of the
/// `std::time::Duration` API. While there are probably some quirks in the API
/// of `std::time::Duration` that could have been fixed here, it is probably
/// more important that it behave "exactly like a `std::time::Duration` but
/// with a sign." That is, this type mirrors the parallels between signed and
/// unsigned integer types.
///
/// While the goal was to match the `std::time::Duration` API as much as
/// possible, there are some differences worth highlighting:
///
/// * As stated, a `SignedDuration` has a sign. Therefore, it uses `i64` and
/// `i32` instead of `u64` and `u32` to represent its 96-bit integer.
/// * Because it's signed, the range of possible values is different. For
/// example, a `SignedDuration::MAX` has a whole number of seconds equivalent
/// to `i64::MAX`, which is less than `u64::MAX`.
/// * There are some additional APIs that don't make sense on an unsigned
/// duration, like [`SignedDuration::abs`] and [`SignedDuration::checked_neg`].
/// * A [`SignedDuration::system_until`] routine is provided as a replacement
/// for [`std::time::SystemTime::duration_since`], but with signed durations.
/// * Constructors and getters for units of hours and minutes are provided,
/// where as these routines are unstable in the standard library.
/// * Unlike the standard library, this type implements the `std::fmt::Display`
/// and `std::str::FromStr` traits via the ISO 8601 duration format, just
/// like the [`Span`](crate::Span) type does. Also like `Span`, the ISO
/// 8601 duration format is used to implement the serde `Serialize` and
/// `Deserialize` traits when the `serde` crate feature is enabled.
/// * The `std::fmt::Debug` trait implementation is a bit different. If you
/// have a problem with it, please file an issue.
/// * At present, there is no `SignedDuration::abs_diff` since there are some
/// API design questions. If you want it, please file an issue.
///
/// # When should I use `SignedDuration` versus [`Span`](crate::Span)?
///
/// Jiff's primary duration type is `Span`. The key differences between it and
/// `SignedDuration` are:
///
/// * A `Span` keeps track of each individual unit separately. That is, even
/// though `1 hour 60 minutes` and `2 hours` are equivalent durations
/// of time, representing each as a `Span` corresponds to two distinct values
/// in memory. And serializing them to the ISO 8601 duration format will also
/// preserve the units, for example, `PT1h60m` and `PT2h`.
/// * A `Span` supports non-uniform units like days, weeks, months and years.
/// Since not all days, weeks, months and years have the same length, they
/// cannot be represented by a `SignedDuration`. In some cases, it may be
/// appropriate, for example, to assume that all days are 24 hours long. But
/// since Jiff sometimes assumes all days are 24 hours (for civil time) and
/// sometimes doesn't (like for `Zoned` when respecting time zones), it would
/// be inappropriate to bake one of those assumptions into a `SignedDuration`.
/// * A `SignedDuration` is a much smaller type than a `Span`. Specifically,
/// it's a 96-bit integer. In contrast, a `Span` is much larger since it needs
/// to track each individual unit separately.
///
/// Those differences in turn motivate some approximate reasoning for when to
/// use `Span` and when to use `SignedDuration`:
///
/// * If you don't care about keeping track of individual units separately or
/// don't need the sophisticated rounding options available on a `Span`, it
/// might be simpler and faster to use a `SignedDuration`.
/// * If you specifically need performance on arithmetic operations involving
/// datetimes and durations, even if it's not as convenient or correct, then it
/// might make sense to use a `SignedDuration`.
/// * If you need to perform arithmetic using a `std::time::Duration` and
/// otherwise don't need the functionality of a `Span`, it might make sense
/// to first convert the `std::time::Duration` to a `SignedDuration`, and then
/// use one of the corresponding operations defined for `SignedDuration` on
/// the datetime types. (They all support it.)
///
/// In general, a `Span` provides more functionality and is overall more
/// flexible. A `Span` can also deserialize all forms of ISO 8601 durations
/// (as long as they're within Jiff's limits), including durations with units
/// of years, months, weeks and days. A `SignedDuration`, by contrast, only
/// supports units up to and including hours.
///
/// # Integration with datetime types
///
/// All datetime types that support arithmetic using [`Span`](crate::Span) also
/// support arithmetic using `SignedDuration` (and [`std::time::Duration`]).
/// For example, here's how to add an absolute duration to a [`Timestamp`]:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{SignedDuration, Timestamp};
///
/// let ts1 = Timestamp::from_second(1_123_456_789)?;
/// assert_eq!(ts1.to_string(), "2005-08-07T23:19:49Z");
///
/// let duration = SignedDuration::new(59, 999_999_999);
/// // Timestamp::checked_add is polymorphic! It can accept a
/// // span or a duration.
/// let ts2 = ts1.checked_add(duration)?;
/// assert_eq!(ts2.to_string(), "2005-08-07T23:20:48.999999999Z");
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// The same API pattern works with [`Zoned`], [`DateTime`], [`Date`] and
/// [`Time`].
///
/// # Interaction with daylight saving time and time zone transitions
///
/// A `SignedDuration` always corresponds to a specific number of nanoseconds.
/// Since a [`Zoned`] is always a precise instant in time, adding a `SignedDuration`
/// to a `Zoned` always behaves by adding the nanoseconds from the duration to
/// the timestamp inside of `Zoned`. Consider `2024-03-10` in `US/Eastern`.
/// At `02:00:00`, daylight saving time came into effect, switching the UTC
/// offset for the region from `-05` to `-04`. This has the effect of skipping
/// an hour on the clocks:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, SignedDuration};
///
/// let zdt = date(2024, 3, 10).at(1, 59, 0, 0).in_tz("US/Eastern")?;
/// assert_eq!(
///     zdt.checked_add(SignedDuration::from_hours(1))?,
///     // Time on the clock skipped an hour, but in this time
///     // zone, 03:59 is actually precisely 1 hour later than
///     // 01:59.
///     date(2024, 3, 10).at(3, 59, 0, 0).in_tz("US/Eastern")?,
/// );
/// // The same would apply if you used a `Span`:
/// assert_eq!(
///     zdt.checked_add(jiff::Span::new().hours(1))?,
///     // Time on the clock skipped an hour, but in this time
///     // zone, 03:59 is actually precisely 1 hour later than
///     // 01:59.
///     date(2024, 3, 10).at(3, 59, 0, 0).in_tz("US/Eastern")?,
/// );
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// Where time zones might have a more interesting effect is in the definition
/// of the "day" itself. If, for example, you encode the notion that a day is
/// always 24 hours into your arithmetic, you might get unexpected results.
/// For example, let's say you want to find the datetime precisely one week
/// after `2024-03-08T17:00` in the `US/Eastern` time zone. You might be
/// tempted to just ask for the time that is `7 * 24` hours later:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, SignedDuration};
///
/// let zdt = date(2024, 3, 8).at(17, 0, 0, 0).in_tz("US/Eastern")?;
/// assert_eq!(
///     zdt.checked_add(SignedDuration::from_hours(7 * 24))?,
///     date(2024, 3, 15).at(18, 0, 0, 0).in_tz("US/Eastern")?,
/// );
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// Notice that you get `18:00` and not `17:00`! That's because, as shown
/// in the previous example, `2024-03-10` was only 23 hours long. That in turn
/// implies that the week starting from `2024-03-08` is only `7 * 24 - 1` hours
/// long. This can be tricky to get correct with absolute durations like
/// `SignedDuration`, but a `Span` will handle this for you automatically:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, ToSpan};
///
/// let zdt = date(2024, 3, 8).at(17, 0, 0, 0).in_tz("US/Eastern")?;
/// assert_eq!(
///     zdt.checked_add(1.week())?,
///     // The expected time!
///     date(2024, 3, 15).at(17, 0, 0, 0).in_tz("US/Eastern")?,
/// );
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// A `Span` achieves this by keeping track of individual units. Unlike a
/// `SignedDuration`, it is not just a simple count of nanoseconds. It is a
/// "bag" of individual units, and the arithmetic operations defined on a
/// `Span` for `Zoned` know how to interpret "day" in a particular time zone
/// at a particular instant in time.
///
/// With that said, the above does not mean that using a `SignedDuration` is
/// always wrong. For example, if you're dealing with units of hours or lower,
/// then all such units are uniform and so you'll always get the same results
/// as with a `Span`. And using a `SignedDuration` can sometimes be simpler
/// or faster.

    /// the duration as given is returned. That is, it's a no-op.
    ///
    /// As is consistent with `SignedDuration` itself, rounding only supports
    /// time units, i.e., units of hours or smaller. If a calendar `Unit` is
    /// provided, then an error is returned. In order to round a duration with
    /// calendar units, you must use [`Span::round`](crate::Span::round) and
    /// provide a relative datetime.
    ///
    /// The parameters are, in brief:
    ///
    /// * [`SignedDurationRound::smallest`] sets the smallest [`Unit`] that
    /// is allowed to be non-zero in the duration returned. By default, it
    /// is set to [`Unit::Nanosecond`], i.e., no rounding occurs. When the
    /// smallest unit is set to something bigger than nanoseconds, then the
    /// non-zero units in the duration smaller than the smallest unit are used
    /// to determine how the duration should be rounded. For example, rounding
    /// `1 hour 59 minutes` to the nearest hour using the default rounding mode
    /// would produce `2 hours`.
    /// * [`SignedDurationRound::mode`] determines how to handle the remainder
    /// when rounding. The default is [`RoundMode::HalfExpand`], which
    /// corresponds to how you were likely taught to round in school.
    /// Alternative modes, like [`RoundMode::Trunc`], exist too. For example,
    /// a truncating rounding of `1 hour 59 minutes` to the nearest hour would
    /// produce `1 hour`.
    /// * [`SignedDurationRound::increment`] sets the rounding granularity to
    /// use for the configured smallest unit. For example, if the smallest unit
    /// is minutes and the increment is 5, then the duration returned will
    /// always have its minute units set to a multiple of `5`.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// In general, there are two main ways for rounding to fail: an improper
    /// configuration like trying to round a duration to the nearest calendar
    /// unit, or when overflow occurs. Overflow can occur when the duration
    /// would exceed the minimum or maximum `SignedDuration` values. Typically,
    /// this can only realistically happen if the duration before rounding is
    /// already close to its minimum or maximum value.
    ///
    /// # Example: round to the nearest second
    ///
    /// This shows how to round a duration to the nearest second. This might
    /// be useful when you want to chop off any sub-second component in a way
    /// that depends on how close it is (or not) to the next second.

///
/// This type provides a way to configure the rounding of a duration. This
/// includes setting the smallest unit (i.e., the unit to round), the rounding
/// increment and the rounding mode (e.g., "ceil" or "truncate").
///
/// `SignedDuration::round` accepts anything that implements
/// `Into<SignedDurationRound>`. There are a few key trait implementations that
/// make this convenient:
///
/// * `From<Unit> for SignedDurationRound` will construct a rounding
/// configuration where the smallest unit is set to the one given.
/// * `From<(Unit, i64)> for SignedDurationRound` will construct a rounding
/// configuration where the smallest unit and the rounding increment are set to
/// the ones given.
///
/// In order to set other options (like the rounding mode), one must explicitly
/// create a `SignedDurationRound` and pass it to `SignedDuration::round`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows how to always round up to the nearest half-minute:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{RoundMode, SignedDuration, SignedDurationRound, Unit};
///
/// let dur = SignedDuration::new(4 * 60 * 60 + 17 * 60 + 1, 123_456_789);
/// let rounded = dur.round(
///     SignedDurationRound::new()
///         .smallest(Unit::Second)
///         .increment(30)
///         .mode(RoundMode::Expand),
