/// A representation of a [time zone].
///
/// A time zone is a set of rules for determining the civil time, via an offset
/// from UTC, in a particular geographic region. In many cases, the offset
/// in a particular time zone can vary over the course of a year through
/// transitions into and out of [daylight saving time].
///
/// A `TimeZone` can be one of three possible representations:
///
/// * An identifier from the [IANA Time Zone Database] and the rules associated
/// with that identifier.
/// * A fixed offset where there are never any time zone transitions.
/// * A [POSIX TZ] string that specifies a standard offset and an optional
/// daylight saving time offset along with a rule for when DST is in effect.
/// The rule applies for every year. Since POSIX TZ strings cannot capture the
/// full complexity of time zone rules, they generally should not be used.
///
/// The most practical and useful representation is an IANA time zone. Namely,
/// it enjoys broad support and its database is regularly updated to reflect
/// real changes in time zone rules throughout the world. On Unix systems,
/// the time zone database is typically found at `/usr/share/zoneinfo`. For
/// more information on how Jiff interacts with The Time Zone Database, see
/// [`TimeZoneDatabase`](crate::tz::TimeZoneDatabase).
///
/// In typical usage, users of Jiff shouldn't need to reference a `TimeZone`
/// directly. Instead, there are convenience APIs on datetime types that accept
/// IANA time zone identifiers and do automatic database lookups for you. For
/// example, to convert a timestamp to a zone aware datetime:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::Timestamp;
///
/// let ts = Timestamp::from_second(1_456_789_123)?;
/// let zdt = ts.in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// assert_eq!(zdt.to_string(), "2016-02-29T18:38:43-05:00[America/New_York]");
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// Or to convert a civil datetime to a zoned datetime corresponding to a
/// precise instant in time:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::date;
///
/// let dt = date(2024, 7, 15).at(21, 27, 0, 0);
/// let zdt = dt.in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// assert_eq!(zdt.to_string(), "2024-07-15T21:27:00-04:00[America/New_York]");
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// Or even converted a zoned datetime from one time zone to another:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::civil::date;
///
/// let dt = date(2024, 7, 15).at(21, 27, 0, 0);
/// let zdt1 = dt.in_tz("America/New_York")?;
/// let zdt2 = zdt1.in_tz("Israel")?;
/// assert_eq!(zdt2.to_string(), "2024-07-16T04:27:00+03:00[Israel]");
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # The system time zone
///
/// The system time zone can be retrieved via [`TimeZone::system`]. If it
/// couldn't be detected or if the `tz-system` crate feature is not enabled,
/// then [`TimeZone::unknown`] is returned. `TimeZone::system` is what's used
/// internally for retrieving the current zoned datetime via [`Zoned::now`].
///
/// While there is no platform independent way to detect your system's
/// "default" time zone, Jiff employs best-effort heuristics to determine it.
/// (For example, by examining `/etc/localtime` on Unix systems or the `TZ`
/// environment variable.) When the heuristics fail, Jiff will emit a `WARN`
/// level log. It can be viewed by installing a `log` compatible logger, such
/// as [`env_logger`].
///
/// # Custom time zones
///
/// At present, Jiff doesn't provide any APIs for manually constructing a
/// custom time zone. However, [`TimeZone::tzif`] is provided for reading
/// any valid TZif formatted data, as specified by [RFC 8536]. This provides
/// an interoperable way of utilizing custom time zone rules.
///
/// # A `TimeZone` is immutable
///
/// Once a `TimeZone` is created, it is immutable. That is, its underlying
/// time zone transition rules will never change. This is true for system time
/// zones or even if the IANA Time Zone Database it was loaded from changes on
/// disk. The only way such changes can be observed is by re-requesting the
/// `TimeZone` from a `TimeZoneDatabase`. (Or, in the case of the system time
/// zone, by calling `TimeZone::system`.)
///
/// # A `TimeZone` is cheap to clone
///
/// A `TimeZone` can be cheaply cloned. It uses automatic reference counting
/// internally. When `alloc` is disabled, cloning a `TimeZone` is still cheap
/// because POSIX time zones and TZif time zones are unsupported. Therefore,
/// cloning a time zone does a deep copy (since automatic reference counting is
/// not available), but the data being copied is small.
///
/// # Time zone equality
///
/// `TimeZone` provides an imperfect notion of equality. That is, when two time
/// zones are equal, then it is guaranteed for them to have the same rules.
/// However, two time zones may compare unequal and yet still have the same
/// rules.
///
/// The equality semantics are as follows:
///
/// * Two fixed offset time zones are equal when their offsets are equal.
/// * Two POSIX time zones are equal when their original rule strings are
/// byte-for-byte identical.
/// * Two IANA time zones are equal when their identifiers are equal _and_
/// checksums of their rules are equal.
/// * In all other cases, time zones are unequal.
///
/// Time zone equality is, for example, used in APIs like [`Zoned::since`]
/// when asking for spans with calendar units. Namely, since days can be of
/// different lengths in different time zones, `Zoned::since` will return an
/// error when the two zoned datetimes are in different time zones and when
/// the caller requests units greater than hours.
///
/// # Dealing with ambiguity
///
/// The principal job of a `TimeZone` is to provide two different
/// transformations:
///
/// * A conversion from a [`Timestamp`] to a civil time (also known as local,
/// naive or plain time). This conversion is always unambiguous. That is,
/// there is always precisely one representation of civil time for any
/// particular instant in time for a particular time zone.
/// * A conversion from a [`civil::DateTime`](crate::civil::DateTime) to an
/// instant in time. This conversion is sometimes ambiguous in that a civil
/// time might have either never appear on the clocks in a particular
/// time zone (a gap), or in that the civil time may have been repeated on the
/// clocks in a particular time zone (a fold). Typically, a transition to
/// daylight saving time is a gap, while a transition out of daylight saving
/// time is a fold.
///
/// The timestamp-to-civil time conversion is done via
/// [`TimeZone::to_datetime`], or its lower level counterpart,
/// [`TimeZone::to_offset`]. The civil time-to-timestamp conversion is done
/// via one of the following routines:
///
/// * [`TimeZone::to_zoned`] conveniently returns a [`Zoned`] and automatically
/// uses the
/// [`Disambiguation::Compatible`](crate::tz::Disambiguation::Compatible)
/// strategy if the given civil datetime is ambiguous in the time zone.
/// * [`TimeZone::to_ambiguous_zoned`] returns a potentially ambiguous
/// zoned datetime, [`AmbiguousZoned`], and provides fine-grained control over
/// how to resolve ambiguity, if it occurs.
/// * [`TimeZone::to_timestamp`] is like `TimeZone::to_zoned`, but returns
/// a [`Timestamp`] instead.
/// * [`TimeZone::to_ambiguous_timestamp`] is like
/// `TimeZone::to_ambiguous_zoned`, but returns an [`AmbiguousTimestamp`]
/// instead.
///
/// Here is an example where we explore the different disambiguation strategies
/// for a fold in time, where in this case, the 1 o'clock hour is repeated:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::{civil::date, tz::TimeZone};
///
/// let tz = TimeZone::get("America/New_York")?;
/// let dt = date(2024, 11, 3).at(1, 30, 0, 0);
/// // It's ambiguous, so asking for an unambiguous instant presents an error!
/// assert!(tz.to_ambiguous_zoned(dt).unambiguous().is_err());
/// // Gives you the earlier time in a fold, i.e., before DST ends:
/// assert_eq!(
///     tz.to_ambiguous_zoned(dt).earlier()?.to_string(),
///     "2024-11-03T01:30:00-04:00[America/New_York]",
/// );
/// // Gives you the later time in a fold, i.e., after DST ends.
/// // Notice the offset change from the previous example!
/// assert_eq!(
///     tz.to_ambiguous_zoned(dt).later()?.to_string(),
///     "2024-11-03T01:30:00-05:00[America/New_York]",
/// );
/// // "Just give me something reasonable"
/// assert_eq!(
///     tz.to_ambiguous_zoned(dt).compatible()?.to_string(),
///     "2024-11-03T01:30:00-04:00[America/New_York]",
/// );
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Serde integration
///
/// At present, a `TimeZone` does not implement Serde's `Serialize` or
/// `Deserialize` traits directly. Nor does it implement `std::fmt::Display`
/// or `std::str::FromStr`. The reason for this is that it's not totally
/// clear if there is one single obvious behavior. Moreover, some `TimeZone`
/// values do not have an obvious succinct serialized representation. (For
/// example, when `/etc/localtime` on a Unix system is your system's time zone,
/// and it isn't a symlink to a TZif file in `/usr/share/zoneinfo`. In which
/// case, an IANA time zone identifier cannot easily be deduced by Jiff.)
///
/// Instead, Jiff offers helpers for use with Serde's [`with` attribute] via
/// the [`fmt::serde`](crate::fmt::serde) module:
///
/// ```
/// use jiff::tz::TimeZone;
///
/// #[derive(Debug, serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
/// struct Record {
///     #[serde(with = "jiff::fmt::serde::tz::optional")]
///     tz: Option<TimeZone>,
/// }
///
/// let json = r#"{"tz":"America/Nuuk"}"#;
/// let got: Record = serde_json::from_str(&json)?;
/// assert_eq!(got.tz, Some(TimeZone::get("America/Nuuk")?));
/// assert_eq!(serde_json::to_string(&got)?, json);
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// Alternatively, you may use the
/// [`fmt::temporal::DateTimeParser::parse_time_zone`](crate::fmt::temporal::DateTimeParser::parse_time_zone)
/// or
/// [`fmt::temporal::DateTimePrinter::print_time_zone`](crate::fmt::temporal::DateTimePrinter::print_time_zone)
/// routines to parse or print `TimeZone` values without using Serde.
