/*!
Provides a parser for [POSIX's `TZ` environment variable][posix-env].

NOTE: Sadly, at time of writing, the actual parser is in `src/shared/posix.rs`.
This is so it can be shared (via simple code copying) with proc macros like
the one found in `jiff-tzdb-static`. The parser populates a "lowest common
denominator" data type. In normal use in Jiff, this type is converted into
the types defined below. This module still does provide the various time zone
operations. Only the parsing is written elsewhere.

The `TZ` environment variable is most commonly used to set a time zone. For
example, `TZ=America/New_York`. But it can also be used to tersely define DST
transitions. Moreover, the format is not just used as an environment variable,
but is also included at the end of TZif files (version 2 or greater). The IANA
Time Zone Database project also [documents the `TZ` variable][iana-env] with
a little more commentary.

Note that we (along with pretty much everyone else) don't strictly follow
POSIX here. Namely, `TZ=America/New_York` isn't a POSIX compatible usage,
and I believe it technically should be `TZ=:America/New_York`. Nevertheless,
apparently some group of people (IANA folks?) decided `TZ=America/New_York`
should be fine. From the [IANA `theory.html` documentation][iana-env]:

> It was recognized that allowing the TZ environment variable to take on values
> such as 'America/New_York' might cause "old" programs (that expect TZ to have
> a certain form) to operate incorrectly; consideration was given to using
> some other environment variable (for example, TIMEZONE) to hold the string
> used to generate the TZif file's name. In the end, however, it was decided
> to continue using TZ: it is widely used for time zone purposes; separately
> maintaining both TZ and TIMEZONE seemed a nuisance; and systems where "new"
> forms of TZ might cause problems can simply use legacy TZ values such as
> "EST5EDT" which can be used by "new" programs as well as by "old" programs
> that assume pre-POSIX TZ values.

Indeed, even [musl subscribes to this behavior][musl-env]. So that's what we do
here too.

Note that a POSIX time zone like `EST5` corresponds to the UTC offset `-05:00`,
and `GMT-4` corresponds to the UTC offset `+04:00`. Yes, it's backwards. How
fun.

# IANA v3+ Support

While this module and many of its types are directly associated with POSIX,
this module also plays a supporting role for `TZ` strings in the IANA TZif
binary format for versions 2 and greater. Specifically, for versions 3 and
greater, some minor extensions are supported here via `IanaTz::parse`. But
using `PosixTz::parse` is limited to parsing what is specified by POSIX.
Nevertheless, we generally use `IanaTz::parse` everywhere, even when parsing
the `TZ` environment variable. The reason for this is that it seems to be what
other programs do in practice (for example, GNU date).

# `no-std` and `no-alloc` support

A big part of this module works fine in core-only environments. But because
core-only environments provide means of indirection, and embedding a
`PosixTimeZone` into a `TimeZone` without indirection would use up a lot of
space (and thereby make `Zoned` quite chunky), we provide core-only support
principally through a proc macro. Namely, a `PosixTimeZone` can be parsed by
the proc macro and then turned into static data.

POSIX time zone support isn't explicitly provided directly as a public API
for core-only environments, but is implicitly supported via TZif. (Since TZif
data contains POSIX time zone strings.)
