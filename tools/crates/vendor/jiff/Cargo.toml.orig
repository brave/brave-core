# When enabled, Jiff will include code that attempts to determine the "system"
# time zone. For example, on Unix systems, this is usually determined by
# looking at the symlink information on /etc/localtime. But in general, it's
# very platform specific and heuristic oriented. On some platforms, this may
# require extra dependencies. (For example, `windows-sys` on Windows.)
tz-system = ["std", "dep:windows-sys"]

# When enabled, Jiff will "fatten" time zone data so that it contains more
# transitions. This uses a little extra heap memory (or binary size, when
# embedding time zone data into your binary) in exchange for generally faster
# time zone lookups.
#
# Why is this a thing? The TZif files that make up the IANA Time Zone Database
# contain both explicit transitions for when offsets change (e.g., twice a
# year for DST) _and_ a more general rule for dealing with offset changes
# that aren't explicitly listed. In the long ago, TZif data only contained the
# explicit transitions. Later, they added support for the general rule
# mechanism, which is only used for "current" transitions. The general rule
# is implemented via, roughly, POSIX time zone strings.
#
# Not all consumers of the IANA Time Zone Database support POSIX time zone
# strings, and so, the TZif files can be built in a "fat" mode that adds extra
# transitions (usually up to the year 2037). This means that if you want to
# find the offset for a timestamp in a particular time zone before 2037, you
# just need to do one very fast binary search on the explicit transitions.
#
# However, these explicit transitions up through 2037 aren't, strictly speaking,
# required. For example, the DST transition rule in the United States is
# perfectly described by a single POSIX time zone string:
#
#     EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0
#
# Therefore, it isn't necessary to add any explicit transitions to, e.g.,
# `America/New_York` after the year 2007. (It would only become necessary if
# the DST transition rule changed.)
#
# Thus, the TZif data files for the IANA Time Zone Database can _also_ be
# generated in a "slim" fashion, where only the historical transitions are
# included. Some platforms use the slim data by default, while others uses
# the fat data.
#
# The problem is that determining the offset from a POSIX time zone can
# generally be more costly than a simple binary search on explicit transitions.
# That in turn means your time zone lookup performance can vary quite a bit due
# to factors generally beyond your control. In order to mitigate this problem,
# Jiff will automatically "fatten" up slim TZif data to include more explicit
# transitions in memory. This smoothes out those performance differences.
#
# Users may want to disable this if they are sensitive to the extra memory
# used. But generally speaking, the extra memory used is no more than what
# would be used by "fat" TZif data files from `/usr/share/zoneinfo`.
tz-fat = ["jiff-static?/tz-fat"]

# When enabled, the `jiff::tz::get` and `jiff::tz::include` proc-macros
# become available. These proc macros enable creating `TimeZone` values in a
# `const` context for use in `core`-only environments.
#
# Users should generally prefer using Jiff's default zoneinfo integration at
# runtime. On Unix systems, this will enable applications using Jiff to get
# automatic tzdb updates when `/usr/share/zoneinfo` is updated without needing
# to re-compile the application.
#
# Note that this introduces a build-time dependency on `jiff-tzdb`.
static = ["static-tz", "jiff-static?/tzdb"]

# When enabled, the `jiff::tz::include` macro becomes available.
#
# This proc-macro parses the TZif data (from a file) at compile time and
# generates a special static structure that can be used by Jiff at runtime
# to do tzdb lookups. This effectively provides a way to use time zones in
# core-only environments without dynamic memory allocation.
#
# This is a subset of the functionality provided by `static`. Namely, this
# doesn't result in a dependency on `jiff-tzdb`. It requires users to include
# the time zone they want as a file, where as enabling `static` (which also
# enables this feature, by necessity) permits using Jiff's bundled tzdb.
static-tz = ["dep:jiff-static"]

# This conditionally bundles tzdb into the binary depending on which platform
# Jiff is being built for.
tzdb-bundle-platform = ["dep:jiff-tzdb-platform", "alloc"]

# This forces the jiff-tzdb crate to be included. If tzdb-zoneinfo is enabled,
# then the system tzdb will take priority over the bundled database.
tzdb-bundle-always = ["dep:jiff-tzdb", "alloc"]

# This enables the system or "zoneinfo" time zone database. This is the
# database that is typically found at /usr/share/zoneinfo on macOS and Linux.
tzdb-zoneinfo = ["std"]

# This enables the system concatenated time zone database. On some platforms,
# like Android, this is the standard time zone database instead of the more
# widespread `zoneinfo` directory created by `zic` itseld.
#
# This being enabled just means that some standard paths will be searched
# for the concatenated database and it will be used if the standard zoneinfo
# directory couldn't be found.
tzdb-concatenated = ["std"]

# This enables bindings to web browser APIs for retrieving the current time
# and configured time zone. This ONLY applies on wasm32-unknown-unknown and
# wasm64-unknown-unknown targets. Specifically, *not* on wasm32-wasi or
# wasm32-unknown-emscripten targets.
#
# This is an "ecosystem" compromise due to the fact that there is no general
# way to determine at compile time whether a wasm target is intended for use
# on the "web." In practice, only wasm{32,64}-unknown-unknown targets are used
# on the web, but wasm{32,64}-unknown-unknown targets can be used in non-web
# contexts as well. Thus, the `js` feature should be enabled only by binaries,
# tests or benchmarks when it is *known* that the application will be used in a
# web context.
#
# Libraries that depend on Jiff should not need to define their own `js`
# feature just to forward it to Jiff. Instead, application authors can depend
# on Jiff directly and enable the `js` feature themselves.
#
# (This is the same dependency setup that the `getrandom` crate uses.)

# When enabled, more aggressive inline annotations are used. This can
# improve performance in some cases, particularly around the areas of parsing
