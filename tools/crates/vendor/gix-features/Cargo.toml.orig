## Provide traits and utilities for providing progress information. These can then be rendered
## using facilities of the `prodash` crate.
progress = ["prodash"]
## Provide human-readable numbers as well as easier to read byte units for progress bars.
progress-unit-human-numbers = ["prodash?/unit-human"]
## Provide human readable byte units for progress bars.
progress-unit-bytes = ["dep:bytesize", "prodash?/unit-bytes"]

## Provide utilities suitable for working with the `std::fs::read_dir()`.
fs-read-dir = ["dep:gix-utils"]

## Implement `tracing` with `tracing-core`, which provides applications with valuable performance details if they opt-in to it.
##
## Note that this may have overhead as well, thus instrumentations should be used stategically, only providing coarse tracing by default and adding details
## only where needed while marking them with the appropriate level.
tracing = ["gix-trace/tracing"]

## If enabled, detailed tracing is also emitted, which can greatly increase insights but at a cost.
tracing-detail = ["gix-trace/tracing-detail"]

## Use scoped threads and channels to parallelize common workloads on multiple objects. If enabled, it is used everywhere
## where it makes sense.
## As caches are likely to be used and instantiated per thread, more memory will be used on top of the costs for threads.
## The `threading` module will contain thread-safe primitives for shared ownership and mutation, otherwise these will be their single threaded counterparts.
## This way, single-threaded applications don't have to pay for threaded primitives.
parallel = ["dep:crossbeam-channel", "dep:parking_lot"]
## If enabled, OnceCell will be made available for interior mutability either in sync or unsync forms.
## Note: This still uses once_cell because std::sync::OnceLock::get_or_try_init() is not yet stable.
once_cell = ["dep:once_cell"]
## Makes facilities of the `walkdir` crate partially available.
## In conjunction with the **parallel** feature, directory walking will be parallel instead behind a compatible interface.
walkdir = ["dep:walkdir", "dep:gix-path", "dep:gix-utils"]
#* an in-memory unidirectional pipe using `bytes` as efficient transfer mechanism.
io-pipe = ["dep:bytes"]
## provide a proven and fast `crc32` implementation.
crc32 = ["dep:crc32fast"]

## Enable the usage of zlib-related utilities to compress or decompress data.
## This enables and uses the high-performance `zlib-rs` backend.
zlib = ["dep:libz-rs-sys", "dep:thiserror"]

#! ### Other

## Count cache hits and misses and print that debug information on drop.
## Caches implement this by default, which costs nothing unless this feature is enabled
