/// This file defines a table of standardized key codes, called "HID usages" used by USB keyboards to identify individual keys.
///
/// A general note on Usages and languages: Due to the variation of keyboards from language to language, it is not feasible
/// to specify exact key mappings for every language. Where this list is not specific for a key function in a language, the
/// closest equivalent key position should be used, so that a keyboard may be modified for a different language by simply printing
/// different keycaps. One example is the Y key on a North American keyboard. In Germany this is typically Z. Rather than changing
/// the keyboard firmware to put the Z Usage into that place in the descriptor list, the vendor uses the Y Usage on both the North
/// American and German keyboards. This continues to be the existing practice in the industry, in order to minimize the number of
/// changes to the electronics to accommodate other languages.
///
/// The following constants are from the USB 'HID Usage Tables' specification, revision 1.1rc3.
///
/// See also [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uikeyboardhidusage?language=objc)
