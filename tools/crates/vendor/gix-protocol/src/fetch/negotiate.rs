/// * figure out all advertised refs on the remote *that we already have* and keep track of the oldest one as cutoff date.
/// * mark all of our own refs as tips for a traversal.
/// * mark all their parents, recursively, up to (and including) the cutoff date up to which we have seen the servers commit that we have.
/// * pass all known-to-be-common-with-remote commits to the negotiator as common commits.
///
/// This is done so that we already find the most recent common commits, even if we are ahead, which is *potentially* better than
/// what we would get if we would rely on tracking refs alone, particularly if one wouldn't trust the tracking refs for some reason.
///
/// Note that git doesn't trust its own tracking refs as the server *might* have changed completely, for instance by force-pushing, so
/// marking our local tracking refs as known is something that's actually not proven to be correct so it's not done.

/// Finally, we also mark tips in the `negotiator` in one go to avoid traversing all refs twice, since we naturally encounter all tips during
/// our own walk.
///
/// Return whether we should negotiate, along with a queue for later use.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `objects`
///     - Access to the object database. *Note* that the `exists()` calls must not trigger a refresh of the ODB packs as plenty of them might fail, i.e. find on object.
/// * `refs`
///     - Access to the git references database.
/// * `alternates`
///     - A function that returns an iterator over `(refs, objects)` for each alternate repository, to assure all known objects are added also according to their tips.
/// * `negotiator`
///     - The implementation that performs the negotiation later, i.e. prepare wants and haves.
/// * `graph`
///     - The commit-graph for use by the `negotiator` - we populate it with tips to initialize the graph traversal.
/// * `ref_map`
///     - The references known on the remote, as previously obtained with [`RefMap::new()`].
/// * `shallow`
///     - How to deal with shallow repositories. It does affect how negotiations are performed.
/// * `mapping_is_ignored`
///     - `f(mapping) -> bool` returns `true` if the given mapping should not participate in change tracking.
///     - [`make_refmapping_ignore_predicate()`] is a typical implementation for this.
