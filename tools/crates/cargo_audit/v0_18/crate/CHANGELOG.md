# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.18.1 (2023-08-31)

### Fixed

- Release workflow: don't enable `fix` and `vendored-openssl` features ([#980])

[#980]: https://github.com/rustsec/rustsec/pull/980

## 0.18.0 (2023-08-31)

### Added

 - Implement proper attribution for advisories licensed under CC-BY ([#955])
 - `cargo audit bin` no longer shows warnings not applicable to the binary type (e.g. no more reports of Windows-only unsoundness in ELF binaries). Previously this was implemented for vulnerabilities, but not warnings. ([#964])

### Changed

 - Upgraded to `rustsec` v0.28, bringing performance, security and compatibility improvements, but also temporarily dropping support for CPU platforms other than x86 and ARM. See the [rustsec changelog](https://github.com/rustsec/rustsec/blob/main/rustsec/CHANGELOG.md) for details.

[#955]: https://github.com/rustsec/rustsec/pull/955
[#964]: https://github.com/rustsec/rustsec/pull/964

## 0.17.6 (2023-05-10)

### Added

 - Upgraded to `cargo-lock` v9.0.0, which enables support for sparse registries.
 - When scanning binary files, the binary's platform is taken into account. This prevents scenarios such as Windows-only vulnerabilities being reported on Linux binaries ([#814])

### Fixed

 - Advisories about `cargo audit` itself are no longer printed multiple times when scanning multiple files ([#848])

[#848]: https://github.com/rustsec/rustsec/pull/848

## 0.17.5 (2023-03-23)

### Added

 - Vulnerability severity is now included in the `cargo audit` output, if known ([#825])

### Changed

 - Advisories marked `informational = unsound` are now reported by default, but only as warnings ([#819]). They do not cause the audit to fail, i.e. the exit code of the process is still 0. This behavior can be suppressed through the configuration file.

### Fixed

 - The help text now correctly refers to the command as `cargo audit` instead of `cargo audit audit` ([#824])
 - The `--version` argument now works correctly, reporting the current version ([#838])

[#824]: https://github.com/rustsec/rustsec/pull/824
[#825]: https://github.com/rustsec/rustsec/pull/825
[#838]: https://github.com/rustsec/rustsec/pull/838

## 0.17.4 (2022-11-08)
### Fixed

 - Checks for yanked crates were broken since 0.17.0. This release restores them and adds tests to prevent future regressions.

### Changed
 - Binary scanning is enabled by default and documented as such. It can still be disabled by disabling the `binary-scanning` feature.

## 0.17.3 (2022-11-01)
### Added

 - `cargo audit bin` now attempts to detect dependencies in binaries not built with [`cargo auditable`](https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-auditable) by parsing the panic messages ([#729]). This only detects about a half of the dependency list and never detects C code such as OpenSSL, but works on any Rust binaries built with `cargo`.
 - Added integration tests for the `--deny=warnings` flag.

### Fixed

 - `cargo audit bin --deny=warnings` no longer exits after finding the first binary with warnings.

### Changed

 - Up to 5x faster `cargo audit bin` when scanning multiple files thanks to caching crates.io index lookups (implemented in `rustsec` crate).
 - Notices about `cargo audit` or `rustsec` will now result in a scanning error being reported (exit code 2) as opposed to reporting them as vulnerabilities in the scanned binary (exit code 1). They are treated as warnings by default, so `--deny=warnings` is required to observe the new behavior.
 - The `binary-scanning` feature that adds the `cargo audit bin` subcommand is now enabled by default, but is not documented as such.
