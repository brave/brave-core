# Updating test browser profiles for perf tests

Profile updating is semi-automated. While CI bots are able to generate new
profiles, some actions should be done manually. The recommended update interval
is once a month.

## Important details

- The profiles are stored as zip archives on the cloud storage.
- `brave-core` stores only sha1 hashes of these profiles.
- Profiles have versions. After updating, the old browser versions continue to
  use the old profiles (using git history to rewind the time). This ensures
  build reproducibility.

## Launching update CI jobs

- To generate an updated profile, launch the job with `EXTRA_ARGS` =
  `--mode update-profile --upload-branch <branch>`.
- Chromium and Brave use different profiles, so two builds for each platforms
  `win`/`mac-arm64`/`android` should be launched. For details, check the
  configurations in `configs/ci/`.
- For CI URLS check [README.md](./README.md)
- CI builds will upload the updated profiles to the cloud storage and make a PR
  from the branch.

## Reviewing the PR

- Check all the profiles are updated (currently 6 profiles).
- Review the changes in `.sizes` files.

## Manual (fallback) way

### Preconditions

- Checkout `brave`, run `npm run sync`
- Obtain write access to the cloud storage (ask @devops-team).
- Remove old downloaded profiles: `rm -rf ./profiles/*.zip`

### Step 1: Upload to the cloud storage

- Download `artifacts.zip` (the URL in the Console Output) from all the builds
  and extract them.
- Each unpacked artifact contains a zip archive with the updated profile (e.g.
  `brave-typical-win.zip`) and `.size` file (e.g.
  `brave-typical-win.zip.sizes`). Copy these files to `./profiles/`.
- Upload the new archives to the cloud storage: see [README.md](./README.md)

### Step 2: Commit changes and make a PR

- The `./profiles/*.sha1` should be updated during the upload. Stage and commit
  changes in `.sha1` and `.size` files.
- DO NOT commit zip files.
- Make a PR to to `brave-core`.

## Testing before merge

If you run a perf CI build on the resulting branch, the old profiles will still
be used (because of versioning). To check new profiles before merging the PR,
run a custom build with `"profile" : <sha1_profile_hash_to_check>` in the
config.
