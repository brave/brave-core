# Updating test browser profiles for perf tests

Profile updating is semi-automated. While CI bots are able to generate new profiles, uploading and PR must be done manually.
The recommended update interval is once a month.

## Important details

* The profiles are stored as zip archives in the`brave-telemetry` bucket on Google Cloud Storage(GCS ) .
* `brave-core` stores only sha1 hashes of these profiles.
* Profiles have versions. After updating, the old browser versions continue to use the old profiles (using git history to rewind the time). This ensures build reproducibility.

## Preconditions

* Obtain write access to the `brave-telemetry` GCS bucket (ask @devops-team).
* Remove old downloaded profiles: `rm -rf ./profiles/*.zip`

## Step 1: CI builds

* To generate an updated profile, launch the job it with `EXTRA_ARGS` = `--mode update_profile`.
* Chromium and Brave use different profiles, so two builds for each platforms win/mac-arm64/android should be launched (6 builds in total). For details, check the configurations in  `configs/ci/`.
* For CI URLS check [README.md](./README.md)

## Step 2: Upload to GCS

* Download `artifacts.zip` (the URL in the Console Output) from all the builds and extract them.
* Each unpacked artifact contains a zip archive with a new profile (e.g. `brave-typical-win.zip`). Copy these to `./profiles/`.
* Upload the new archives to GCS: `cd profiles; upload_to_google_storage.py --bucket=brave-telemetry *.zip`;

## Step 3: Commit changes and make a PR

* The `./profiles/*.sha1` should be updated during the upload. Stage and commit these changes.
* DO NOT commit zip files.
* Make a PR to to `brave-core`.
* Note: If you run a perf CI build on the resulting branch, the old profiles will still be used (because of versioning).
To check new profiles before merging the PR, run a custom build with `"profile" : <sha1_profile_hash_to_check>` in the config.
