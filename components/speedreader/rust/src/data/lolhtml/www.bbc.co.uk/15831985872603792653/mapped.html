                            <p><strong>BBC journalist and broadcaster Sophie Raworth is also a serious runner. Since 2011, she has completed 15 marathons and three ultra-marathons &ndash; and she has just been selected to represent England in the over-50s women&rsquo;s team in the Fleet Half Marathon. </strong></p>

                            <p><strong>O</strong><strong>n 13 March 2020, as part of Sport Relief, <a title="BBC Sport Relief: Beat Beethoven" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2WNrqCTxYpn7h0hz1tq4XBr/can-you-beat-beethoven" target="_blank">Sophie will take part in Beat Beethoven</a> &ndash; a five kilometre race that she&rsquo;ll try to complete within the time it takes the BBC Philharmonic orchestra to play Beethoven&rsquo;s epic Fifth Symphony live. </strong></p>
                    <p><strong>But everyone has to start somewhere. For Sophie, that was with a 5K run in the park. We asked for her tips...</strong></p>
                    <h3><strong>1. Never say never</strong></h3>
<p>My first and top tip for running is to never think you're too old, which a lot of people do. I didn't start running until I was 42, and now I'm about to run for England! It's never too late. And don&rsquo;t worry about being unfit. You will get fit!</p>
                    <h3>2. Motivate yourself with a goal</h3>
<p>Five kilometres is 3.1 miles. That may not sound like a lot, but it IS a lot if you haven&rsquo;t done any exercise at all. When I first started running, I couldn't even run two miles. I had to stop all the time. My lungs were burning and everything hurt. So if you&rsquo;re just starting out, get the Couch to 5K app. It&rsquo;s fantastic. In the space of nine weeks, it teaches you to go from zero to being able to run a 5K.</p>

                            <h3>3. Run with other people</h3>
<p>Lots of people are intimidated about running for the first time because they think that everyone's going to look at them and they'll be too slow. But it's just not like that. Runners are really supportive people and it&rsquo;s a very social sport.</p>
                    <p>It helps if you can make running part of your routine. I first got into running through <a title="parkrunUK" href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk/" target="_blank">parkrun</a>, which happens every Saturday at 9am in hundreds of parks all over the world. It&rsquo;s free: all you do is go to the website, find your local parkrun, get a barcode and turn up. It&rsquo;s the most supportive community, with people who run 5K in 15 minutes and people who walk it in an hour.</p>
                    <p>If you've never run before, go to parkrun and walk it. Then the next week, go back and try to run for a bit, then walk again.</p>
                    <h3>4. Pace yourself</h3>
<p>A lot of people will go out for their first run and start running really fast, almost sprinting. If you do that, you&rsquo;ll run out of energy and think "I really can't do this" after a mile.</p>
                    <p>When you run your first 5K, hold back and run a steady pace, because it's actually quite a long way! You have to build up until you know what you can achieve.</p>
                    <p>There are really good running apps you can get on your phone, or running watches you can use to track your pace. They let you see your progress, and it can be quite motivating to see yourself getting faster.</p>
                    <p>If you really want to run faster, the key is doing speed sessions. You need to push yourself with interval training, where you run for a minute faster, then slow down, then another minute fast.</p>

                            <h3>5. Warm down properly</h3>
<p>It's good to warm up a bit at the start of a run, but the most important thing is stretching at the end, when your muscles are tired. When you first start running, you&rsquo;re using muscles you haven&rsquo;t used before, in a way you haven&rsquo;t used them before. When I did my first marathon, I was so stiff afterwards &ndash; I&rsquo;d forgotten how much it could hurt!</p>
                <div class="1/2@bpw pull--right-spaced@bpw">
                                            </div>
                            <p>But it's good to persevere. What I've discovered through running is the space it gives you. I&rsquo;ll sometimes go out for a run really not wanting to, but I always come back with my mood lifted. You will never regret a run!</p>
