Windows has a feature called Smart Multi-Homed Name Resolution, which can expose information about your location and the sites you visit.

Brave has a helper service that protects you from this exposure by filtering the way DNS queries are made on your VPN connection.

However, we noticed this helper service is not running - and we don't want to leave you unprotected. We’ve changed the DNS settings in the browser to protect against this exposure. The settings will remain in effect and locked while the VPN is connected.

Looks like there are some issues with the WireGuard connection. Want to enable IKEv2 fallback for a reliable VPN? Simply restart your browser.

Need help with compatibility or configuration? Reach out to our friendly support team.
You can always revert back to WireGuard on brave://settings/system.

Let's get you connected!
