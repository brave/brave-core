Brave Ads is a [layered component](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/design-documents/layered-components-design). It has the following structure:

    └── components/
        └── brave_ads/
            ├── core/ ¹
            │   ├── mojom/ ²
            │   ├── public/ ³
            │   ├── internal/ ⁴
            │   └── test/ ⁵
            ├── content/ ⁶
            ├── browser/ ⁷
            └── resources/ ⁸

1. The shared code that does not depend on the Content API.
2. The public mojom data structures.
3. The public API surface of the component.
4. The internal implementation of public/. Not visible to consumers.
5. The data used in tests.
6. The code layered above core/ that integrates with the Content API.
7. Browser process code which is specific for Desktop and Android platforms. Code therein will be eventually transitioned to core/ and content/.
8. The runtime resource data.

## Command Line Switches

| switch  | explanation  |
|---|---|
| rewards  | Multiple options can be comma separated (no spaces). Note: all options are in the format `foo=x`. Values are case-insensitive. Options are `staging`, which forces ads to use the staging environment if set to `true` or the production environment if set to `false`. `debug`, which reduces the delay before downloading the catalog, fetching subdivisions, paying out confirmation tokens, and submitting conversions if set to `true`. e.g. `--rewards=staging=true,debug=true`.  |
| vmodule  | Options are `--vmodule` gives the per-module maximal V-logging levels to override the value given by `--v`, e.g., `"*/brave_ads/*"=6,"*/bat_ads/*"=6` would change the logging level for Brave Ads to 6.  |
| use-dev-goupdater-url  | Options are `--use-dev-goupdater-url`, which forces the component updater to use the dev environment.  |

## Logs
