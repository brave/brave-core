  // 2. It is resilient to device reboots.
  // 3. It can be reset in *some* way by the user. In Particular, it can *not*
  //    be based only on a MAC address of a physical device. The specific
  //    implementation varies across platforms, some of them requiring a round
  //    trip to the IO or FILE thread. "callback" will always be called on the
  //    UI thread though (sometimes directly if the implementation allows
  //    running on the UI thread). The returned value is
  //    HMAC_SHA256(|raw_device_id|), so that the actual device identifier value
  //    is not exposed directly to the caller.
  //
  // NOTE: This device id must never leave the device.
