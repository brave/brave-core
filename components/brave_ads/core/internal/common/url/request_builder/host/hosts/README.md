# URL Hosts

URL host names can be classified into anonymous and non-anonymous types based on their level of anonymity.

An anonymous URL host name does not reveal any identifying information about the user accessing the endpoint. A non-anonymous URL host name, on the other hand, reveals identifying information about the user accessing the endpoint.
