# Targeting Latent Interest User Model

In advertising, the latent interest segment refers to a group of consumers who may not have expressed explicit interest in a product or service, but exhibit characteristics or behaviors that suggest potential interest. Advertisers target this segment in hopes of uncovering hidden or developing interests, aiming to generate awareness and stimulate interest among these individuals.
