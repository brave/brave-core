In advertising, the interest segment based on browsing behavior and contextual targeting involves identifying and targeting users based on their online activities and the context of their current online experience. Advertisers analyze users' past browsing behavior to understand their interests and deliver relevant ads in the context of the content they are currently engaging with. This approach aims to align advertisements with users' interests and the context of their online environment for more effective engagement.
