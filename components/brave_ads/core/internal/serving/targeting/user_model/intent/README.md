# Targeting Intent User Model

In advertising, the intent segment refers to a specific group of consumers who have demonstrated a clear interest or intent towards a particular product or service. Advertisers target these segments based on user behavior, search queries, or other indicators that suggest a higher likelihood of conversion. This approach aims to deliver more relevant ads to users, increasing the chances of engagement and conversion.
