  <message name="IDS_SEARCH_ENGINE_CHOICE_PAGE_SUBTITLE" desc="This is the body text of a screen that prompts the user to select the search engine that they want to use by default. (A search engine provides answers to search queries; this is different from a browser, which displays web pages. A search engine powers many experiences within a browser.) This screen appears when the user opens Brave after updating or installing the app. The headline for this screen is “Choose your search engine”. Below this line, users will see a list of search engines to choose from. This screen’s heading establishes “search engine” as the object of the screen, and the screen demonstrates a list of search engines; so, translate “These are shown” with the correct agreement to refer to “search engines”. The screen's goal is to help users understand that they can use any search engine with Brave, that the search engines are displayed in random order, and that the user can change their mind at any time. If “your default” cannot be used as a standalone noun in your language, please use the shorter of these alternative phrases: “your default search engine”; “your default choice”. Ensure that “your default” refers to the user’s choice for their default search engine, and cannot be misunderstood as a default option provided by Brave (as Brave no longer provides a default option for affected users).  The “Learn more” link opens a card that explains why users are being prompted and what a search engine does in Brave.">
    These are shown in random order. You can change your default anytime.
