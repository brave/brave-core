  Disable Speedreader in Brave.

  Speedreader is a feature that provides a clutter-free reading experience by automatically cleaning up articles and simplifying page layouts.

            If this policy is set to true, Speedreader will always be disabled and all related UI elements will be hidden.

            If this policy is set to false, Speedreader will always be enabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, Speedreader will be enabled by default (subject to user preferences).
