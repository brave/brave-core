caption: Control default cosmetic filtering behavior through Brave Shields
desc: |-
  This policy determines how Brave hides unwanted page elements like empty ad spaces, social media widgets, and other visual clutter.

  If this policy is set to 1 (DisableCosmeticFiltering), cosmetic filtering is disabled entirely, allowing all page elements to display.

  If this policy is set to 2 (StandardCosmeticFiltering), third-party cosmetic elements like empty ad spaces and social media widgets are hidden while preserving first-party content.

  If this policy is set to 3 (AggressiveCosmeticFiltering), comprehensive cosmetic filtering is applied, hiding both first-party and third-party unwanted page elements including empty ad spaces, social media widgets, and other visual clutter.

  If left unset, Brave uses the default cosmetic filtering behavior (standard filtering), but users can modify this setting through Brave Shields.
