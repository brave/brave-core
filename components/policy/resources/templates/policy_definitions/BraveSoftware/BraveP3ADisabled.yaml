  Disable Privacy Preserving Product Analytics in Brave.

  Privacy Preserving Product Analytics (P3A) is an opt-in feature that helps Brave estimate (using private and non-identifying responses) the overall usage of certain features and make them better for users.

            If this policy is set to true, P3A will always be disabled and all related UI elements will be hidden.

            If this policy is set to false, P3A will be enabled by default.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, P3A will be enabled by default (subject to user preferences).
