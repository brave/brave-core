caption: Control default referrer behavior through Brave Shields
desc: |-
  This policy determines whether websites can access referrer information when users navigate from one site to another.

  If this policy is set to 1 (AllowReferrers), normal referrer header transmission is permitted, allowing websites to see which site the user came from. Some sites may require this for functionality.

  If this policy is set to 2 (BlockReferrers), websites are prevented from seeing which site the user came from, enhancing privacy by blocking referrer information from being sent.

  If left unset, Brave uses the default referrer behavior (blocks referrers), but users can modify this setting through Brave Shields.
