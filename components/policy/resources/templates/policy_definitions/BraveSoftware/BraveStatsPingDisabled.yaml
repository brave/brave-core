caption: Disable Stats Usage Ping
default: null
desc: |-
  Disable anonymous stats usage ping in Brave.

  The anonymous stats usage ping is an opt-in feature that helps Brave estimate active user totals.

  If this policy is set to true, the usage ping will always be disabled and all related UI elements will be hidden.

  If this policy is set to false, the usage ping will be enabled by default.

  If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

  If this policy is left unset, the usage ping will be enabled by default (subject to user preferences).
