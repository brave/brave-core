caption: Control default tracker blocking behavior through Brave Shields
desc: |-
  This policy determines how Brave handles tracking scripts and analytics that monitor user behavior.

  If this policy is set to 1 (AllowTrackers), tracking scripts are permitted to function normally on websites, which may reduce privacy but improve site compatibility.

  If this policy is set to 2 (BlockTrackers), trackers, analytics scripts, and other privacy-invasive content are prevented from loading on websites using Brave's tracker blocking filters.

  If left unset, Brave uses the default tracker blocking behavior (blocks trackers), but users can modify this setting through Brave Shields.
