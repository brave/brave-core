caption: Control default HTTPS upgrade behavior through Brave Shields
desc: |-
  This policy determines how Brave handles HTTP to HTTPS upgrades to improve connection security.

  If this policy is set to 1 (AllowHttp), HTTP connections are allowed without attempting upgrades to HTTPS.

  If this policy is set to 2 (PreferHttps), HTTP is upgraded to HTTPS when available, with fallback to HTTP if HTTPS fails.

  If this policy is set to 3 (RequireHttps), HTTPS connections are required and HTTP requests are blocked.

  If left unset, Brave uses the default HTTPS upgrade behavior (standard upgrades), but users can modify this setting through Brave Shields.
