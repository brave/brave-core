caption: Control HTTPS upgrade behavior
default: null
desc: |-
  This policy determines how Brave handles HTTP to HTTPS upgrades to improve connection security.

            If this policy is set to 1 (Disabled), HTTP connections are allowed.

            If this policy is set to 2 (Strict), HTTPS connections are required. Users get an interstitial if HTTPS upgrade not possible.

            If this policy is set to 3 (Standard), HTTP is upgraded to HTTPS when available.

            If left unset, users can configure the HTTPS upgrade behavior in Brave Shields settings.
