  Disable Brave Talk in Brave.

  Brave Talk is a feature that allows users to start private video calls with friends and colleagues directly from the browser.

            If this policy is set to true, Brave Talk will always be disabled and all related UI elements will be hidden.

            If this policy is set to false, Brave Talk will always be enabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, Brave Talk will be enabled by default (subject to user preferences).
