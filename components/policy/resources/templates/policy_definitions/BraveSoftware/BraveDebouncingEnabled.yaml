caption: Control debouncing feature to protect against bounce tracking.
default: null
desc: |-
  Debouncing protects users against bounce tracking by recognizing when the user is about to visit a known tracking domain, skipping the tracking site altogether, and instead directly navigating the user to their intended destination. This prevents trackers from circumventing third-party storage restrictions by injecting intermediate tracking sites between the user and their intended destination.

  If this policy is set to true, debouncing will be enabled to protect users from bounce tracking by redirecting them directly to their intended destinations.

  If this policy is set to false, debouncing will be disabled and users may be subject to bounce tracking techniques.

  If this policy is left unset, debouncing will be controlled by the user setting (enabled by default).
