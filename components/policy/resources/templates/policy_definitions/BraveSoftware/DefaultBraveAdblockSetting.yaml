caption: Control adblock behavior
default: null
desc: |-
  This policy determines how Brave handles ads on web pages.

            If this policy is set to 1 (AllowAds), ads are allowed to be displayed on websites.

            If this policy is set to 2 (BlockAds), ads are blocked.

            If left unset, ads are blocked by default, but users can modify this by:
            - changing the "Trackers &amp; ads blocking" control to "Disabled" in Shields settings, or to "Allow all trackers &amp; ads" in the Shields panel
            - disabling Shields on a specific site
