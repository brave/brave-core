  Disable Wayback Machine integration in Brave.

  Wayback Machine integration is a feature that provides access to archived versions of web pages when encountering 404 errors or other unavailable content.

            If this policy is set to true, Wayback Machine integration will always be disabled and all related UI elements (including the URL bar icon and settings) will be hidden.

            If this policy is set to false, Wayback Machine integration will always be enabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, Wayback Machine integration will be enabled by default (subject to user preferences).
