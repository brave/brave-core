  Brave Playlist allows users to save videos and audio from web pages to play later offline or in the background.

            If this policy is set to true, Playlist will be enabled and all related UI elements will be shown.

            If this policy is set to false, Playlist will be disabled.

            If this policy is unset, Playlist will be enabled by default and users can choose to disable it.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.
