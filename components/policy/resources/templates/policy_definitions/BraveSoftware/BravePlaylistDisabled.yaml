  Disable Brave Playlist functionality.

  Brave Playlist allows users to save videos and audio from web pages to play later offline or in the background.

            If this policy is set to true, Playlist will always be disabled and all related UI elements will be hidden.

            If this policy is set to false or unset, Playlist will be enabled by default.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.
