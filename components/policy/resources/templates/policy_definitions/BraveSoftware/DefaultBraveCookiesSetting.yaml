caption: Control default cookie behavior through Brave Shields
desc: |-
  This policy uses Brave's enhanced cookie control system to manage how websites can store and access cookies.

  If this policy is set to 1 (AllowCookies), all cookies are permitted to be stored on websites.

  If this policy is set to 2 (BlockCookies), all cookies are prevented from being stored on websites.

  If this policy is set to 3 (BlockThirdPartyCookies), cookies from other websites are prevented while allowing cookies from the website you're visiting.

  If left unset, Brave uses the default cookie behavior (blocks third-party cookies while allowing first-party cookies), but users can modify this setting through Brave Shields.
