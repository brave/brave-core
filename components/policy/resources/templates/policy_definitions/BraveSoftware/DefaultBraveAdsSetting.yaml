caption: Control default ad blocking behavior through Brave Shields
desc: |-
  This policy determines how Brave handles advertisements and promotional content on web pages.

  If this policy is set to 1 (AllowAds), advertisements are permitted to be displayed normally on websites.

  If this policy is set to 2 (BlockAds), ads, trackers, and other promotional content are filtered out using Brave's ad blocking lists.

  If left unset, Brave uses the default ad blocking behavior (blocks ads), but users can modify this setting through Brave Shields.
