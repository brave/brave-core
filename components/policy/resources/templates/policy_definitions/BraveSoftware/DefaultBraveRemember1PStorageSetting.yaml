caption: Control default first-party storage retention behavior through Brave Shields
desc: |-
  This policy determines whether Brave remembers or forgets first-party storage data (like localStorage, sessionStorage, and other site data) when users close tabs or navigate away.

  If this policy is set to 1 (RememberFirstPartyStorage), first-party storage data (like localStorage, sessionStorage, and other site data) is preserved across browser sessions, allowing sites to maintain user preferences and state.

  If this policy is set to 2 (ForgetFirstPartyStorage), first-party storage data (like localStorage, sessionStorage, and other site data) is cleared when tabs are closed or users navigate away, enhancing privacy but potentially requiring users to re-enter preferences.

  If left unset, Brave uses the default storage behavior, but users can modify this setting through Brave Shields.
