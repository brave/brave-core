  Disable Brave News in Brave.

  Brave News is a feature that allows users to view curated news content from various sources in a private feed on the new tab page.

            If this policy is set to true, Brave News will always be disabled and all related UI elements will be hidden.

            If this policy is set to false, Brave News will always be enabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, Brave News will be enabled by default (subject to user preferences).
