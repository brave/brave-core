We're using a personal pronoun to improve tone and make the moment more conversational, but that's not required and you can replace this with 'Brave is launching new privacy features...' * 'new privacy features': This screen is the first encounter users have with Privacy Sandbox (www.privacysandbox.com), Brave's effort to deprecate third-party cookies. This paragraph speaks broadly to the effort and so references multiple settings, even though the user, in this moment, is consenting (or not) to one single setting: Ad topics. * 'more choice over the ads you see': This phrase suggests a comparison. We're comparing the new features with third-party cookies, the old manner advertisers had to track users and show personalized ads. The 'more choice' we're providing is the possibility to block certain ad topics. So if the user sets Brave settings to allow personalized ads, the user can block an ad topic like 'Sports'. This is one input among others, so it doesn't necessarily mean the user won't see ads related to sports, but it's more control than they have today and it can be a meaningful control. **** CONTEXT PRIVACY SANDBOX **** Brave’s Privacy Sandbox initiative 1) deprecates third-party cookies in Brave, 2) supports free and open content on the web (by finding better ways to support ads online), 3) while providing stronger privacy protections for users.

  <message name="IDS_PRIVACY_SANDBOX_M1_CONSENT_DESCRIPTION_2" desc="* 'Ad topics' is both the name of a new Brave setting and the concept of topics of interest used to influence ads. For legal reasons, it's important that we convey the name of the setting to users so that they can find the setting of the same name in Brave settings. * 'help sites': The setting allows users to decide whether or not a site they visit can ask Brave for ad topics (topics of interests) that Brave estimates based on the user's browsing history. It's simply a 'help' and not an 'allow' because a site the user visits might have many means of showing the user personalized ads—Brave's new Ad topics setting is just one of them. * 'relevant ads' is another way to say 'personalized ads' * 'while protecting your browsing history and identity': Today, with third-party cookies, an ad company can track a user from site to site, and often know who the user is by name. The new settings help sites maintain personalized ads while limiting sites from tracking users from site to site, another way to say 'protecting your browsing history'. * 'Brave can note...': This explains how the new setting works. When the Ad topics setting is on, a user gives Brave permission to consider the user's browsing history to determine topics of interest that Brave can then share with sites so that a site can show personalized ads based on the user's topics of interest. * 'recent browsing history': At the time of launch, this is a 4 week window. For example, imagine you spend time looking at web sites related to model airplanes. With this setting on, Brave can use this info to choose topics of interest. But then for the next 4 weeks, you don't look at any sites related to model airplanes. Topics of interest are deleted after 4 weeks on a rolling basis, so after 4 weeks the fact that you looked at sites related to model airplanes won't have any influence on the topics of interests chosen by Brave. * 'Later' helps the user understand that there are 2 stages relative to this setting. In the first stage, Brave can estimate the user's interests based on their browsing history. Later, as the user continues browsing, a site can ask Brave for topics of interest used to personalize ads.

We define 'personalize' as 'when Brave provides recommendations and other content for users based on their data'. At a high level, there are 4 things that affect whether an ad is personalized in this context: * 'this setting' refers to the 'Ad topics' setting. The user is on this page. * 'Site-suggested ads': this is a link to the other new ad setting Brave is launching and that sites can use to personalize ads a user sees. * 'cookie settings': this is a link to the cookies control section in Brave settings. The Privacy Sandbox project deprecates third-party cookies, but it's a process, and we're launching new functionality that will replace important functionality of cookies. Until third-party cookies are deprecated, the two systems remain active in Brave. * 'site you're viewing personalizes ads': When a user engages with a site, Brave has no control over whether that site shows the user personalized ads. Imagine you visit www.interesting-site.com and they know a lot about you already based on previous visits. They can personalize content and ads to you if they like. They can use an ad-serving product, like Facebook or Brave Ads to deliver personalized ads. They can also use the new Privacy Sandbox APIs (if they so choose) in order to get more information about the user that could be helpful to them in order to personalize ads. Those 2 APIs (settings, from the user's perspective), are 'Ad topics' and 'Site-suggested ads'.">
       As you browse, whether an ad you see is personalized depends on this setting, Site-suggested ads, your cookie settings, and if the site you’re viewing personalizes ads
