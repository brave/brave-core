We want users to associate the new feature with the familiar autofill functionality they're already used to but want to convey how it's different (AI). * “automatically” should feel valuable to users as the autofill service is making tasks for them simpler. * “more fields”: the existing autofill functionality in Brave covers things like passwords, credit cards, and building addresses.
