# Machine Learning (ML)

This directory provides a consistent structure for implementing machine learning processes within Brave Core. The subdirectories are structured as:

## Pipeline

Defines the instructions for the various steps of a ML process. Often instructions are detailed by components loaded in from external Brave-sources.

## Data

Defines data structures useful for handling data when implementing ML processes

## Transformation

Algorithms for applying pre-processing transformations to model input data

## Model

Functions for applying ML models, such as generating predictions
