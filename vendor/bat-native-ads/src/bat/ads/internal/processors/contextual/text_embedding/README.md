# Text Embedding Processor

This processor allows text data to be transformed into a vector that carries semantic meaning. The vector representation is created by averaging individual word vectors that are in-vocabulary (provided in the ads resources component). The word vectors themselves come from a pre-trained model. These vectors are intended to be used by downstream prediction tasks.
