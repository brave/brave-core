The same for the third week, for a total of 15 potential interests. In week 4, Brave will automatically delete the 5 interests from week 1 so that there aren’t ever more than 15 topics associated with a user at any given time. * “interests can refresh”: If a user loves horror films and reads about them for months on end, the interest “Horror movies” might get deleted and refreshed in the same week, so that “Horror movies” doesn’t ever disappear from the user’s list of interests. * “Or you can…”: A user might love horror movies but can’t stand the idea of seeing ads about horror movies (because even the visuals will ruin the surprise of opening night). In this case, the user can remove “Horror movies” from the list of interests Brave will consider. This removal remains in place indefinitely.

    Sites can store information with Brave about your interests. For example, if you visit a site to buy shoes for a marathon, the site might define your interest as running marathons.
