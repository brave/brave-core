### sources.gni

#### Background

The use of sources.gni was initially added to help deal with the issue of
circular dependencies. We often subclass upstream code like
`BraveContentBrowserClient` -> `ChromeContentBrowserClient`, but in
`//brave/browser` instead of `//chrome/browser`. This created a circular
dependency because:

- `BraveContentBrowserClient` depends on `//chrome/brave`.
- `//chrome/brave` depends on `//chrome/brave` because it now was to instantiate
  `BraveContentBrowserClient` instead of `ChromeContentBrowserClient`.

This became a problem when we started running `gn check` and `checkdeps` so
worked around it by using `sources.gni` to add
`sources += brave_chrome_browser_sources` so both `BraveContentBrowserClient`
and `ChromeContentBrowserClient` were in the same target. This is mainly an
issue for `//chrome/browser` and `//chrome/browser/ui` and upstream is actively
working to break these up so we need to make sure we are not adding to the
problem on our side.

#### Usage of sources.gni

Use of sources.gni to include sources in `//chrome/browser` and
`//chrome/browser/ui` should be avoided, see [Circular
dependencies](#circular-dependencies). Adding deps through sources.gni is
generally ok. Use of sources.gni to include sources in other targets can be used
if the there is no reasonable way to avoid it using the options below.

This does not mean that you cannot ever use sources.gni. For instance it may be
appropriate when adding a very small number of sources to an existing upstream
target, but please consider other approaches below first. Using sources.gni to
add dependencies and other non-source configuration to upstream targets is
generally ok.

#### Methods to avoid circular dependencies

Whenever possible try to break circular dependencies see
[Recipes for Breaking Chrome Dependencies](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/cookbook/#recipes-for-breaking-chrome-dependencies) and
[Dependency Inversion](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/cookbook/#dependency-inversion) for examples.

An interface/impl pattern can also often be used where header files and possibly
some cc files are included in the direct dependency and the code that would
cause the circular dependency is included in a higher level target like
`//brave/browser` to ensure that the implementation code is always linked into
the final output. See [tabs:tabs_public](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/ui/tabs/BUILD.gn;l=12;drc=ad947f73e5449afe74659d107eb34e2521bee100) and [tabs:impl](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/ui/tabs/BUILD.gn;l=300;drc=ad947f73e5449afe74659d107eb34e2521bee100) and [//chrome/browser impl
dependency](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/BUILD.gn;l=4378;drc=265bc11af3dc764e0f59f93016aa350bbfa5f814).

The chromium ios code is also a good model for separating out dependencies and
sometimes makes use of interface/implementation patterns.

Another technique to avoid circular dependencies is to use a template so the
subclass does not need a dependency on the base class.

brave_class.h
```cpp
template <typename ChromeClass>
class BraveClass : public ChromeClass {
  ...
}
```

The chrome target that we override will need a dependency on the brave target,
but there is no circular dependency some_chromium_source.cc
```cpp
  chrome_class_ = std::make_unique<ChromeClass>();
```

chromium_src/some_chromium_source.cc
```cpp
#define ChromeClass BraveClass<ChromeClass>()
```

#### Circular dependencies {#circular-dependencies}

Circular dependencies can sometimes (temporarily) use
`allow_circular_includes_from` to split sources up into smaller targets so they
can be more easily resolved down the road. This is the technique we should use
for `//chrome/browser` and `//chrome/browserui` if the circular dependencies
cannot be removed through the methods above. It may be appropriate in other
cases, check in slack if you are unsure. See [`//chrome/browser`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/BUILD.gn;l=3524;drc=80bd94ca218b30eb74a107ea54b469d79b25f16d) and
[`//chrome/browser/ui`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/ui/BUILD.gn;l=5752;drc=fe55ddc4724a631b7e1752ac29310cfb3de4a8c5) for examples. Also
[https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/25892/files](https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/25892/files) for an example in brave-core
of converting from sources.gni.

Do not use `check_includes = false` to suppress errors about circular includes.
