# Ignoring Files from Format and Presubmit Checks

This document describes all the ways to ignore files from format and presubmit
checks in the Brave codebase. The main use cases are ignoring files that are
vendored from external sources or generated by tools.

## Quick Reference Table

| File Type / Check    | Configuration File                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **C/C++**            | add `.clang-format` in target directory   |
| **JS/TS/CSS/etc.**   | `//brave/.prettierignore`                 |
| **Python**           | `//brave/.yapfignore`                     |
| **Rust**             | `//.rustfmt.toml` (via patching)          |
| **Presubmit Checks** | `//brave/chromium_presubmit_config.json5` |

## Detailed Instructions

### Python Files

To ignore Python files from formatting checks, add them to
`//brave/.yapfignore`.

The `.yapfignore` file uses pattern matching (fnmatch) to exclude files from
yapf formatting. Add one pattern per line.

### C/C++ Files (clang-format)

To ignore C/C++ files from clang-format checks, you need to add a
`.clang-format` file in the target directory with the following configuration:

```
DisableFormat: true
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable both formatting and include sorting for files in that
directory and its subdirectories.

### JavaScript/TypeScript/CSS/HTML Files

To ignore JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, and other files handled by
Prettier, add them to `//brave/.prettierignore`.

The `.prettierignore` file uses gitignore-style patterns to exclude files from
Prettier formatting.

### Rust Files

To ignore directories from rustfmt formatting checks, you need to modify
`//.rustfmt.toml` via patching.

The `.rustfmt.toml` file contains an `ignore` array that lists directories to
exclude from rustfmt formatting. Add directory patterns to this array to ignore
them.

### Presubmit Checks

To ignore files from presubmit checks, you need to adjust the
`default_files_to_skip` configuration in
`//brave/chromium_presubmit_config.json5`.

This configuration controls which files are skipped during presubmit checks.
**This does not affect the formatting checks.**
