The DS_Store files in this directory configure the background image and shortcut
positions in Brave's DMG archives.

The files are checked into version control but can be regenerated by running the
`main.py` script in this directory. This requires the `ds_store` Python library.
The script was tested with Python 3.12.8, `ds_store` 1.3.1 and `mac_alias`
2.2.2.
