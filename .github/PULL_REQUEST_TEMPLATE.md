## Checklist:

- Review design docs
  [Browser design principles](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/chrome_browser_design_principles.md)
  [Style guide](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/styleguide/c++/c++.md)
  [Core principles](https://www.chromium.org/developers/core-principles/)
- Ensure there are (tests)[https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/]. Unit test as much as possible (including edge cases), but also include browser tests covering high level functionality.
- Ensure that there are comments explaining what classes/methods are/do. The "why" is often more important than the "what" in comments. Also update any relevant docs (moving docs from wiki to brave-core if necessary).
- Request security or other review (third-party libraries, rust code, etc...) if applicable [security/privacy review is needed](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Security-reviews) [other review](https://github.com/brave/reviews/issues/new/choose)
  Also see [adding third-party libraries](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/adding_to_third_party.md) for general guidelines on using third party code

- Write a good [PR/commit description](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/cl-descriptions.html)
