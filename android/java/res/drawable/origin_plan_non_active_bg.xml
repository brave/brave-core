<!-- Background drawable for unselected subscription plan in Origin paywall.

     This drawable is applied when a subscription plan is not currently selected.
     It provides subtle visual indication through:
     - Dimmed background color to show inactive state
     - No border to contrast with selected state
     - Same rounded corners for visual consistency

     Used in: activity_brave_origin_plans.xml for plan selector backgrounds
