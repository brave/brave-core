/// A Cow-like borrowed object "yoked" to its backing data.
///
/// This allows things like zero copy deserialized data to carry around
/// shared references to their backing buffer, by "erasing" their static lifetime
/// and turning it into a dynamically managed one.
///
/// `Y` (the [`Yokeable`]) is the object containing the references,
/// and will typically be of the form `Foo<'static>`. The `'static` is
/// not the actual lifetime of the data, rather it is a convenient way to mark the
/// erased lifetime and make it dynamic.
///
/// `C` is the "cart", which `Y` may contain references to. After the yoke is constructed,
/// the cart serves little purpose except to guarantee that `Y`'s references remain valid
/// for as long as the yoke remains in memory (by calling the destructor at the appropriate moment).
///
/// The primary constructor for [`Yoke`] is [`Yoke::attach_to_cart()`]. Several variants of that
/// constructor are provided to serve numerous types of call sites and `Yoke` signatures.
///
/// The key behind this type is [`Yoke::get()`], where calling [`.get()`][Yoke::get] on a type like
/// `Yoke<Cow<'static, str>, _>` will get you a short-lived `&'a Cow<'a, str>`, restricted to the
/// lifetime of the borrow used during `.get()`. This is entirely safe since the `Cow` borrows from
/// the cart type `C`, which cannot be interfered with as long as the `Yoke` is borrowed by `.get
/// ()`. `.get()` protects access by essentially reifying the erased lifetime to a safe local one
/// when necessary.
///
/// Furthermore, there are various [`.map_project()`][Yoke::map_project] methods that allow turning a `Yoke`
/// into another `Yoke` containing a different type that may contain elements of the original yoked
/// value. See the [`Yoke::map_project()`] docs for more details.
///
/// In general, `C` is a concrete type, but it is also possible for it to be a trait object.
///
/// # Example
///
/// For example, we can use this to store zero-copy deserialized data in a cache:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use yoke::Yoke;
/// # use std::rc::Rc;
/// # use std::borrow::Cow;
/// # fn load_from_cache(_filename: &str) -> Rc<[u8]> {
/// #     // dummy implementation
/// #     Rc::new([0x5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f])
/// # }
///
/// fn load_object(filename: &str) -> Yoke<Cow<'static, str>, Rc<[u8]>> {
///     let rc: Rc<[u8]> = load_from_cache(filename);
///     Yoke::<Cow<'static, str>, Rc<[u8]>>::attach_to_cart(rc, |data: &[u8]| {
///         // essentially forcing a #[serde(borrow)]
///         Cow::Borrowed(bincode::deserialize(data).unwrap())
///     })
/// }
///
/// let yoke = load_object("filename.bincode");
/// assert_eq!(&**yoke.get(), "hello");
/// assert!(matches!(yoke.get(), &Cow::Borrowed(_)));
/// ```

///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// F: for<'de> FnOnce(&'de <C as Deref>::Target) -> <Y as Yokeable<'de>>::Output,
/// C::Target: 'static
/// ```
///
/// to enforce that the yoking closure produces a yokeable that is *only* allowed to borrow from the cart.
/// A way to be sure of this is as follows: imagine if `F` *did* borrow data of lifetime `'a` and stuff it in
/// its output. Then that lifetime `'a` would have to live at least as long as `'de` *for all `'de`*.
/// The only lifetime that satisfies that is `'static` (since at least one of the potential `'de`s is `'static`),
/// and we're fine with that.
///
/// ## Implied bounds and variance
///
/// The `C::Target: 'static` bound is tricky, however. Let's imagine a situation where we *didn't* have that bound.
///
/// One thing to remember is that we are okay with the cart itself borrowing from places,
/// e.g. `&[u8]` is a valid cart, as is `Box<&[u8]>`. `C` is not `'static`.
///
/// (I'm going to use `CT` in prose to refer to `C::Target` here, since almost everything here has to do
/// with C::Target and not C itself.)
///
/// Unfortunately, there's a sneaky additional bound inside `F`. The signature of `F` is *actually*
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// F: for<'de> where<C::Target: 'de> FnOnce(&'de C::Target) -> <Y as Yokeable<'de>>::Output
/// ```
///
/// using made-up "where clause inside HRTB" syntax to represent a type that can be represented inside the compiler
/// and type system but not in Rust code. The `CT: 'de` bond comes from the `&'de C::Target`: any time you
/// write `&'a T`, an implied bound of `T: 'a` materializes and is stored alongside it, since references cannot refer
/// to data that itself refers to data of shorter lifetimes. If a reference is valid, its referent must be valid for
/// the duration of the reference's lifetime, so every reference *inside* its referent must also be valid, giving us `T: 'a`.
/// This kind of constraint is often called a "well formedness" constraint: `&'a T` is not "well formed" without that
/// bound, and rustc is being helpful by giving it to us for free.
///
/// Unfortunately, this messes with our universal quantification. The `for<'de>` is no longer "For all lifetimes `'de`",
/// it is "for all lifetimes `'de` *where `CT: 'de`*". And if `CT` borrows from somewhere (with lifetime `'ct`), then we get a
/// `'ct: 'de` bound, and `'de` candidates that live longer than `'ct` won't actually be considered.
/// The neat little logic at the beginning stops working.
///
/// `attach_to_cart()` will instead enforce that the produced yokeable *either* borrows from the cart (fine), or from
/// data that has a lifetime that is at least `'ct`. Which means that `attach_to_cart()` will allow us to borrow locals
/// provided they live at least as long as `'ct`.
///
/// Is this a problem?
///
/// This is totally fine if CT's lifetime is covariant: if C is something like `Box<&'ct [u8]>`, even if our
/// yoked object borrows from locals outliving `'ct`, our Yoke can't outlive that
/// lifetime `'ct` anyway (since it's a part of the cart type), so we're fine.
///
/// However it's completely broken for contravariant carts (e.g. `Box<fn(&'ct u8)>`). In that case
/// we still get `'ct: 'de`, and we still end up being able to
/// borrow from locals that outlive `'ct`. However, our Yoke _can_ outlive
/// that lifetime, because Yoke shares its variance over `'ct`
/// with the cart type, and the cart type is contravariant over `'ct`.
/// So the Yoke can be upcast to having a longer lifetime than `'ct`, and *that* Yoke
/// can outlive `'ct`.

/// We fix this by forcing `C::Target: 'static` in `attach_to_cart()`, which would make it work
/// for fewer types, but would also allow Yoke to continue to be covariant over cart lifetimes if necessary.
///
/// An alternate fix would be to not allowing yoke to ever be upcast over lifetimes contained in the cart
/// by forcing them to be invariant. This is a bit more restrictive and affects *all* `Yoke` users, not just
/// those using `attach_to_cart()`.
///
/// See https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x/issues/2926
/// See also https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/106431 for potentially fixing this upstream by
/// changing how the bound works.
///
/// # Tests
///
/// Here's a broken `attach_to_cart()` that attempts to borrow from a local:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// use yoke::Yoke;
///
/// let cart = vec![1, 2, 3, 4].into_boxed_slice();
/// let local = vec![4, 5, 6, 7];
/// let yoke: Yoke<&[u8], Box<[u8]>> = Yoke::attach_to_cart(cart, |_| &*local);
/// ```
///
/// Fails as expected.
///
/// And here's a working one with a local borrowed cart that does not do any sneaky borrows whilst attaching.
///
/// ```rust
/// use yoke::Yoke;
///
/// let cart = vec![1, 2, 3, 4].into_boxed_slice();
/// let local = vec![4, 5, 6, 7];
/// let yoke: Yoke<&[u8], &[u8]> = Yoke::attach_to_cart(&cart, |c| &*c);
/// ```
///
/// Here's an `attach_to_cart()` that attempts to borrow from a longer-lived local due to
/// the cart being covariant. It fails, but would not if the alternate fix of forcing Yoke to be invariant
/// were implemented. It is technically a safe operation:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// use yoke::Yoke;
/// // longer lived
/// let local = vec![4, 5, 6, 7];
///
/// let backing = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
/// let cart = Box::new(&*backing);
///
/// let yoke: Yoke<&[u8], Box<&[u8]>> = Yoke::attach_to_cart(cart, |_| &*local);
/// println!("{:?}", yoke.get());
/// ```
///
/// Finally, here's an `attach_to_cart()` that attempts to borrow from a longer lived local
/// in the case of a contravariant lifetime. It does not compile, but in and of itself is not dangerous:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// use yoke::Yoke;
///
/// type Contra<'a> = fn(&'a ());
///
/// let local = String::from("Hello World!");
/// let yoke: Yoke<&'static str, Box<Contra<'_>>> = Yoke::attach_to_cart(Box::new((|_| {}) as _), |_| &local[..]);
/// println!("{:?}", yoke.get());
/// ```
///
/// It is dangerous if allowed to transform (testcase from #2926)
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// use yoke::Yoke;
///
/// type Contra<'a> = fn(&'a ());
///
///
/// let local = String::from("Hello World!");
/// let yoke: Yoke<&'static str, Box<Contra<'_>>> = Yoke::attach_to_cart(Box::new((|_| {}) as _), |_| &local[..]);
/// println!("{:?}", yoke.get());
/// let yoke_longer: Yoke<&'static str, Box<Contra<'static>>> = yoke;
/// let leaked: &'static Yoke<&'static str, Box<Contra<'static>>> = Box::leak(Box::new(yoke_longer));
/// let reference: &'static str = leaked.get();
///
/// println!("pre-drop: {reference}");
/// drop(local);
/// println!("post-drop: {reference}");
/// ```
