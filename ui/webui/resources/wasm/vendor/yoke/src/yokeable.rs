/// The `Yokeable<'a>` trait is implemented on the `'static` version of any zero-copy type; for
/// example, `Cow<'static, T>` implements `Yokeable<'a>` (for all `'a`).
///
/// One can use
/// `Yokeable::Output` on this trait to obtain the "lifetime'd" value of the `Cow<'static, T>`,
/// e.g. `<Cow<'static, T> as Yokeable<'a>'>::Output` is `Cow<'a, T>`.
///
/// A [`Yokeable`] type is essentially one with a covariant lifetime parameter,
/// matched to the parameter in the trait definition. The trait allows one to cast
/// the covariant lifetime to and from `'static`.
///
/// **Most of the time, if you need to implement [`Yokeable`], you should be able to use the safe
/// [`#[derive(Yokeable)]`](yoke_derive::Yokeable) custom derive.**
///
/// While Rust does not yet have GAT syntax, for the purpose of this documentation
/// we shall refer to "`Self` with a lifetime `'a`" with the syntax `Self<'a>`.
/// Self<'static> is a stand-in for the HKT Self<'_>: lifetime -> type.
///
/// With this terminology, [`Yokeable`]  exposes ways to cast between `Self<'static>` and `Self<'a>` generically.
/// This is useful for turning covariant lifetimes to _dynamic_ lifetimes, where `'static` is
/// used as a way to "erase" the lifetime.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This trait is safe to implement on types with a _covariant_ lifetime parameter, i.e. one where
/// [`Self::transform()`]'s body can simply be `{ self }`. This will occur when the lifetime
/// parameter is used within references, but not in the arguments of function pointers or in mutable
/// positions (either in `&mut` or via interior mutability)
///
/// This trait must be implemented on the `'static` version of such a type, e.g. one should
/// implement `Yokeable<'a>` (for all `'a`) on `Cow<'static, T>`.
///
/// This trait is also safe to implement on types that do not borrow memory.
///
/// There are further constraints on implementation safety on individual methods.
///
/// # Trait bounds
///
/// [Compiler bug #85636](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85636) makes it tricky to add
/// trait bounds on `Yokeable::Output`. For more information and for workarounds, see
/// [`crate::trait_hack`].
///
/// # Implementation example
///
/// Implementing this trait manually is unsafe. Where possible, you should use the safe
/// [`#[derive(Yokeable)]`](yoke_derive::Yokeable) custom derive instead. We include an example
/// in case you have your own zero-copy abstractions you wish to make yokeable.

    /// Typically covariant lifetimes become invariant when hidden behind an `&mut`,

    /// The reason behind this is that while _reading_ a covariant lifetime that has been cast to a shorter
    /// one is always safe (this is roughly the definition of a covariant lifetime), writing
    /// may not necessarily be safe since you could write a smaller reference to it. For example,
    /// the following code is unsound because it manages to stuff a `'a` lifetime into a `Cow<'static>`
    ///
    /// ```rust,compile_fail
    /// # use std::borrow::Cow;
    /// # use yoke::Yokeable;
    /// struct Foo {
    ///     str: String,
    ///     cow: Cow<'static, str>,
    /// }
    ///
    /// fn unsound<'a>(foo: &'a mut Foo) {
    ///     let a: &str = &foo.str;
    ///     foo.cow.transform_mut(|cow| *cow = Cow::Borrowed(a));
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// However, this code will not compile because [`Yokeable::transform_mut()`] requires `F: 'static`.
    /// This enforces that while `F` may mutate `Self<'a>`, it can only mutate it in a way that does
    /// not insert additional references. For example, `F` may call `to_owned()` on a `Cow` and mutate it,
    /// but it cannot insert a new _borrowed_ reference because it has nowhere to borrow _from_ --
    /// `f` does not contain any borrowed references, and while we give it `Self<'a>` (which contains borrowed
    /// data), that borrowed data is known to be valid
    ///
    /// Note that the `for<'b>` is also necessary, otherwise the following code would compile:
    ///
    /// ```rust,compile_fail

    /// which is unsound because `bar` could be moved later, and we do not want to be able to
    /// self-insert references to it.

    /// The `for<'b>` enforces this by stopping the author of the closure from matching up the input
    /// `&'b Self::Output` lifetime with `'a` and borrowing directly from it.

    ///  - a reference field in Self<'a>: this does not extend the set of
