error[E0271]: type mismatch resolving `<[u8; 1] as KnownLayout>::PointerMetadata == usize`
  --> tests/ui-msrv/transmute-mut-src-unsized.rs:17:35
   |
17 | const SRC_UNSIZED: &mut [u8; 1] = transmute_mut!(&mut [0u8][..]);
   |                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `()`, found `usize`
   |
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `TransmuteMutDst<'_>` for `Wrap<&mut [u8], &mut [u8; 1]>`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `transmute_mut` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
