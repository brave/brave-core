//! # Overview
//!
//! ##### Conversion Traits
//!
//! Zerocopy provides four derivable traits for zero-cost conversions:
//! - [`TryFromBytes`] indicates that a type may safely be converted from
//!   certain byte sequences (conditional on runtime checks)
//! - [`FromZeros`] indicates that a sequence of zero bytes represents a valid
//!   instance of a type
//! - [`FromBytes`] indicates that a type may safely be converted from an
//!   arbitrary byte sequence
//! - [`IntoBytes`] indicates that a type may safely be converted *to* a byte
//!   sequence
//!
//! These traits support sized types, slices, and [slice DSTs][slice-dsts].
//!
//! [slice-dsts]: KnownLayout#dynamically-sized-types
//!
//! ##### Marker Traits
//!
//! Zerocopy provides three derivable marker traits that do not provide any
//! functionality themselves, but are required to call certain methods provided
//! by the conversion traits:
//! - [`KnownLayout`] indicates that zerocopy can reason about certain layout
//!   qualities of a type
//! - [`Immutable`] indicates that a type is free from interior mutability,
//!   except by ownership or an exclusive (`&mut`) borrow
//! - [`Unaligned`] indicates that a type's alignment requirement is 1
//!
//! You should generally derive these marker traits whenever possible.
//!
//! ##### Conversion Macros
//!
//! Zerocopy provides six macros for safe casting between types:
//!
//! - ([`try_`][try_transmute])[`transmute`] (conditionally) converts a value of
//!   one type to a value of another type of the same size
//! - ([`try_`][try_transmute_mut])[`transmute_mut`] (conditionally) converts a
//!   mutable reference of one type to a mutable reference of another type of
//!   the same size
//! - ([`try_`][try_transmute_ref])[`transmute_ref`] (conditionally) converts a
//!   mutable or immutable reference of one type to an immutable reference of
//!   another type of the same size
//!
//! These macros perform *compile-time* size and alignment checks, meaning that
//! unconditional casts have zero cost at runtime. Conditional casts do not need
//! to validate size or alignment runtime, but do need to validate contents.
//!
//! These macros cannot be used in generic contexts. For generic conversions,
//! use the methods defined by the [conversion traits](#conversion-traits).
//!
//! ##### Byteorder-Aware Numerics
//!
//! Zerocopy provides byte-order aware integer types that support these
//! conversions; see the [`byteorder`] module. These types are especially useful
//! for network parsing.
//!
//! # Cargo Features
//!
//! - **`alloc`**
//!   By default, `zerocopy` is `no_std`. When the `alloc` feature is enabled,
//!   the `alloc` crate is added as a dependency, and some allocation-related
//!   functionality is added.
//!
//! - **`std`**
//!   By default, `zerocopy` is `no_std`. When the `std` feature is enabled, the
//!   `std` crate is added as a dependency (ie, `no_std` is disabled), and
//!   support for some `std` types is added. `std` implies `alloc`.
//!
//! - **`derive`**
//!   Provides derives for the core marker traits via the `zerocopy-derive`
//!   crate. These derives are re-exported from `zerocopy`, so it is not
//!   necessary to depend on `zerocopy-derive` directly.
//!
//!   However, you may experience better compile times if you instead directly
//!   depend on both `zerocopy` and `zerocopy-derive` in your `Cargo.toml`,
//!   since doing so will allow Rust to compile these crates in parallel. To do
//!   so, do *not* enable the `derive` feature, and list both dependencies in
//!   your `Cargo.toml` with the same leading non-zero version number; e.g:
//!
//!   ```toml
//!   [dependencies]
//!   zerocopy = "0.X"
//!   zerocopy-derive = "0.X"
//!   ```
//!
//!   To avoid the risk of [duplicate import errors][duplicate-import-errors] if
//!   one of your dependencies enables zerocopy's `derive` feature, import
//!   derives as `use zerocopy_derive::*` rather than by name (e.g., `use
//!   zerocopy_derive::FromBytes`).
//!
//! - **`simd`**
//!   When the `simd` feature is enabled, `FromZeros`, `FromBytes`, and
//!   `IntoBytes` impls are emitted for all stable SIMD types which exist on the
//!   target platform. Note that the layout of SIMD types is not yet stabilized,
//!   so these impls may be removed in the future if layout changes make them
//!   invalid. For more information, see the Unsafe Code Guidelines Reference
//!   page on the [layout of packed SIMD vectors][simd-layout].
//!
//! - **`simd-nightly`**
//!   Enables the `simd` feature and adds support for SIMD types which are only
//!   available on nightly. Since these types are unstable, support for any type
//!   may be removed at any point in the future.
//!
//! - **`float-nightly`**
//!   Adds support for the unstable `f16` and `f128` types. These types are
//!   not yet fully implemented and may not be supported on all platforms.
//!

//!
//! # Security Ethos
//!
//! Zerocopy is expressly designed for use in security-critical contexts. We
//! strive to ensure that that zerocopy code is sound under Rust's current
//! memory model, and *any future memory model*. We ensure this by:
//! - **...not 'guessing' about Rust's semantics.**
//!   We annotate `unsafe` code with a precise rationale for its soundness that
//!   cites a relevant section of Rust's official documentation. When Rust's
//!   documented semantics are unclear, we work with the Rust Operational
//!   Semantics Team to clarify Rust's documentation.
//! - **...rigorously testing our implementation.**
//!   We run tests using [Miri], ensuring that zerocopy is sound across a wide
//!   array of supported target platforms of varying endianness and pointer
//!   width, and across both current and experimental memory models of Rust.
//! - **...formally proving the correctness of our implementation.**
//!   We apply formal verification tools like [Kani][kani] to prove zerocopy's
//!   correctness.
//!
//! For more information, see our full [soundness policy].

//! # Relationship to Project Safe Transmute
//!
//! [Project Safe Transmute] is an official initiative of the Rust Project to
//! develop language-level support for safer transmutation. The Project consults
//! with crates like zerocopy to identify aspects of safer transmutation that
//! would benefit from compiler support, and has developed an [experimental,
//! compiler-supported analysis][mcp-transmutability] which determines whether,
//! for a given type, any value of that type may be soundly transmuted into
//! another type. Once this functionality is sufficiently mature, zerocopy
//! intends to replace its internal transmutability analysis (implemented by our
//! custom derives) with the compiler-supported one. This change will likely be
//! an implementation detail that is invisible to zerocopy's users.
//!
//! Project Safe Transmute will not replace the need for most of zerocopy's
//! higher-level abstractions. The experimental compiler analysis is a tool for
//! checking the soundness of `unsafe` code, not a tool to avoid writing
//! `unsafe` code altogether. For the foreseeable future, crates like zerocopy
//! will still be required in order to provide higher-level abstractions on top
//! of the building block provided by Project Safe Transmute.

///
/// # Limitations
///
/// This derive cannot currently be applied to unsized structs without an

///
/// Some invocations of this derive run afoul of a [known bug] in Rust's type

///
/// ```compile_fail,E0446
/// use zerocopy::*;
/// # use zerocopy_derive::*;

/// #[derive(KnownLayout)]
/// #[repr(C)]
/// pub struct PublicType {
///     leading: Foo,
///     trailing: Bar,
/// }
///
/// #[derive(KnownLayout)]
/// struct Foo;
///
/// #[derive(KnownLayout)]
/// struct Bar;
/// ```
///
/// ...results in a compilation error:
///
/// ```text
/// error[E0446]: private type `Bar` in public interface
///  --> examples/bug.rs:3:10
///    |
/// 3  | #[derive(KnownLayout)]
///    |          ^^^^^^^^^^^ can't leak private type
/// ...
/// 14 | struct Bar;
///    | ---------- `Bar` declared as private
///    |
///    = note: this error originates in the derive macro `KnownLayout` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

///
/// This issue arises when `#[derive(KnownLayout)]` is applied to `repr(C)`

///
/// **Do not implement this trait yourself!** Instead, use

///
/// This derive performs a sophisticated analysis to deduce the layout
/// characteristics of types. You **must** implement this trait via the derive.
///
/// # Dynamically-sized types
///
/// `KnownLayout` supports slice-based dynamically sized types ("slice DSTs").
///
/// A slice DST is a type whose trailing field is either a slice or another
/// slice DST, rather than a type with fixed size. For example:
///
/// ```
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct PacketHeader {
/// # /*
///     ...
/// # */
/// }
///
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct Packet {
///     header: PacketHeader,
///     body: [u8],
/// }
/// ```
///
/// It can be useful to think of slice DSTs as a generalization of slices - in
/// other words, a normal slice is just the special case of a slice DST with
/// zero leading fields. In particular:
/// - Like slices, slice DSTs can have different lengths at runtime
/// - Like slices, slice DSTs cannot be passed by-value, but only by reference
///   or via other indirection such as `Box`
/// - Like slices, a reference (or `Box`, or other pointer type) to a slice DST
///   encodes the number of elements in the trailing slice field
///
/// ## Slice DST layout
///
/// Just like other composite Rust types, the layout of a slice DST is not
/// well-defined unless it is specified using an explicit `#[repr(...)]`
/// attribute such as `#[repr(C)]`. [Other representations are
/// supported][reprs], but in this section, we'll use `#[repr(C)]` as our
/// example.
///
/// A `#[repr(C)]` slice DST is laid out [just like sized `#[repr(C)]`
/// types][repr-c-structs], but the presenence of a variable-length field
/// introduces the possibility of *dynamic padding*. In particular, it may be
/// necessary to add trailing padding *after* the trailing slice field in order
/// to satisfy the outer type's alignment, and the amount of padding required
/// may be a function of the length of the trailing slice field. This is just a
/// natural consequence of the normal `#[repr(C)]` rules applied to slice DSTs,
/// but it can result in surprising behavior. For example, consider the
/// following type:
///
/// ```
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct Foo {
///     a: u32,
///     b: u8,
///     z: [u16],
/// }

/// In this value, `z` has length 0. Abiding by `#[repr(C)]`, the lowest offset

/// round up to offset 6. This means that there is one byte of padding between
/// `b` and `z`, then 0 bytes of `z` itself (denoted `><` in this diagram), and
/// then two bytes of padding after `z` in order to satisfy the overall
/// alignment of `Foo`. The size of this instance is 8 bytes.
///
/// What about if `z` has length 1?
///
/// ```text
/// byte offset | 01234567
///       field | aaaab-zz
/// ```
///
/// In this instance, `z` has length 1, and thus takes up 2 bytes. That means

/// Now `z` has length 2, and thus takes up 4 bytes. This brings our un-padded

/// satisfy `Foo`'s alignment.
///
/// Again, all of this is just a logical consequence of the `#[repr(C)]` rules

/// ## What is a valid size?
///
/// There are two places in zerocopy's API that we refer to "a valid size" of a
/// type. In normal casts or conversions, where the source is a byte slice, we
/// need to know whether the source byte slice is a valid size of the
/// destination type. In prefix or suffix casts, we need to know whether *there
/// exists* a valid size of the destination type which fits in the source byte
/// slice and, if so, what the largest such size is.
///
/// As outlined above, a slice DST's size is defined by the number of elements
/// in its trailing slice field. However, there is not necessarily a 1-to-1
/// mapping between trailing slice field length and overall size. As we saw in
/// the previous section with the type `Foo`, instances with both 0 and 1
/// elements in the trailing `z` field result in a `Foo` whose size is 8 bytes.
///
/// When we say "x is a valid size of `T`", we mean one of two things:
/// - If `T: Sized`, then we mean that `x == size_of::<T>()`
/// - If `T` is a slice DST, then we mean that there exists a `len` such that the instance of
///   `T` with `len` trailing slice elements has size `x`
///
/// When we say "largest possible size of `T` that fits in a byte slice", we
/// mean one of two things:
/// - If `T: Sized`, then we mean `size_of::<T>()` if the byte slice is at least
///   `size_of::<T>()` bytes long
/// - If `T` is a slice DST, then we mean to consider all values, `len`, such
///   that the instance of `T` with `len` trailing slice elements fits in the
///   byte slice, and to choose the largest such `len`, if any
///

/// This derive ensures that the runtime check of whether bytes correspond to a

///
/// # What is a "valid instance"?
///
/// In Rust, each type has *bit validity*, which refers to the set of bit
/// patterns which may appear in an instance of that type. It is impossible for
/// safe Rust code to produce values which violate bit validity (ie, values
/// outside of the "valid" set of bit patterns). If `unsafe` code produces an
/// invalid value, this is considered [undefined behavior].
///
/// Rust's bit validity rules are currently being decided, which means that some
/// types have three classes of bit patterns: those which are definitely valid,
/// and whose validity is documented in the language; those which may or may not
/// be considered valid at some point in the future; and those which are
/// definitely invalid.
///
/// Zerocopy takes a conservative approach, and only considers a bit pattern to
/// be valid if its validity is a documenteed guarantee provided by the
/// language.
///
/// For most use cases, Rust's current guarantees align with programmers'
/// intuitions about what ought to be valid. As a result, zerocopy's
/// conservatism should not affect most users.
///
/// If you are negatively affected by lack of support for a particular type,
/// we encourage you to let us know by [filing an issue][github-repo].
///
/// # `TryFromBytes` is not symmetrical with [`IntoBytes`]
///
/// There are some types which implement both `TryFromBytes` and [`IntoBytes`],
/// but for which `TryFromBytes` is not guaranteed to accept all byte sequences
/// produced by `IntoBytes`. In other words, for some `T: TryFromBytes +
/// IntoBytes`, there exist values of `t: T` such that
/// `TryFromBytes::try_ref_from_bytes(t.as_bytes()) == None`. Code should not
/// generally assume that values produced by `IntoBytes` will necessarily be
/// accepted as valid by `TryFromBytes`.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// On its own, `T: TryFromBytes` does not make any guarantees about the layout
/// or representation of `T`. It merely provides the ability to perform a
/// validity check at runtime via methods like [`try_ref_from_bytes`].
///
/// You must not rely on the `#[doc(hidden)]` internals of `TryFromBytes`.
/// Future releases of zerocopy may make backwards-breaking changes to these
/// items, including changes that only affect soundness, which may cause code
/// which uses those items to silently become unsound.

///
/// *This section describes, roughly, the analysis performed by this derive to
/// determine whether it is sound to implement `FromBytes` for a given type.
/// Unless you are modifying the implementation of this derive, or attempting to
/// manually implement `FromBytes` for a type yourself, you don't need to read
/// this section.*
///
/// If a type has the following properties, then this derive can implement
/// `FromBytes` for that type:
///
/// - If the type is a struct, all of its fields must be `FromBytes`.
/// - If the type is an enum:
///   - It must have a defined representation which is one of `u8`, `u16`, `i8`,
///     or `i16`.
///   - The maximum number of discriminants must be used (so that every possible
///     bit pattern is a valid one).
///   - Its fields must be `FromBytes`.
///
/// This analysis is subject to change. Unsafe code may *only* rely on the
/// documented [safety conditions] of `FromBytes`, and must *not* rely on the
/// implementation details of this derive.
///
/// ## Why isn't an explicit representation required for structs?
///
/// Neither this derive, nor the [safety conditions] of `FromBytes`, requires
/// that structs are marked with `#[repr(C)]`.
///
/// Per the [Rust reference](reference),
///
/// > The representation of a type can change the padding between fields, but
/// > does not change the layout of the fields themselves.
///
/// [reference]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#representations
///
/// Since the layout of structs only consists of padding bytes and field bytes,
/// a struct is soundly `FromBytes` if:
/// 1. its padding is soundly `FromBytes`, and
/// 2. its fields are soundly `FromBytes`.
///
/// The answer to the first question is always yes: padding bytes do not have
/// any validity constraints. A [discussion] of this question in the Unsafe Code
/// Guidelines Working Group concluded that it would be virtually unimaginable
/// for future versions of rustc to add validity constraints to padding bytes.
///
/// [discussion]: https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/174
///
/// Whether a struct is soundly `FromBytes` therefore solely depends on whether
/// its fields are `FromBytes`.

/// Types for which any bit pattern is valid.
///
/// Any memory region of the appropriate length which contains initialized bytes
/// can be viewed as any `FromBytes` type with no runtime overhead. This is
/// useful for efficiently parsing bytes as structured data.
///
/// # Warning: Padding bytes
///
/// Note that, when a value is moved or copied, only the non-padding bytes of
/// that value are guaranteed to be preserved. It is unsound to assume that
/// values written to padding bytes are preserved after a move or copy. For
/// example, the following is unsound:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use core::mem::{size_of, transmute};
/// use zerocopy::FromZeros;
/// # use zerocopy_derive::*;
///
/// // Assume `Foo` is a type with padding bytes.
/// #[derive(FromZeros, Default)]
/// struct Foo {
/// # /*
///     ...
/// # */
/// }
///
/// let mut foo: Foo = Foo::default();
/// FromZeros::zero(&mut foo);
/// // UNSOUND: Although `FromZeros::zero` writes zeros to all bytes of `foo`,
/// // those writes are not guaranteed to be preserved in padding bytes when
/// // `foo` is moved, so this may expose padding bytes as `u8`s.
/// let foo_bytes: [u8; size_of::<Foo>()] = unsafe { transmute(foo) };

/// # Error Messages
///
/// On Rust toolchains prior to 1.78.0, due to the way that the custom derive
/// for `IntoBytes` is implemented, you may get an error like this:
///
/// ```text
/// error[E0277]: the trait bound `(): PaddingFree<Foo, true>` is not satisfied
///   --> lib.rs:23:10
///    |
///  1 | #[derive(IntoBytes)]
///    |          ^^^^^^^^^ the trait `PaddingFree<Foo, true>` is not implemented for `()`
///    |
///    = help: the following implementations were found:
///                   <() as PaddingFree<T, false>>
/// ```
///
/// This error indicates that the type being annotated has padding bytes, which
/// is illegal for `IntoBytes` types. Consider reducing the alignment of some
/// fields by using types in the [`byteorder`] module, wrapping field types in
/// [`Unalign`], adding explicit struct fields where those padding bytes would
/// be, or using `#[repr(packed)]`. See the Rust Reference's page on [type

/// # Unions
///
/// Currently, union bit validity is [up in the air][union-validity], and so
/// zerocopy does not support `#[derive(IntoBytes)]` on unions by default.
/// However, implementing `IntoBytes` on a union type is likely sound on all
/// existing Rust toolchains - it's just that it may become unsound in the
/// future. You can opt-in to `#[derive(IntoBytes)]` support on unions by
/// passing the unstable `zerocopy_derive_union_into_bytes` cfg:
///
/// ```shell
/// $ RUSTFLAGS='--cfg zerocopy_derive_union_into_bytes' cargo build
/// ```
///
/// However, it is your responsibility to ensure that this derive is sound on
/// the specific versions of the Rust toolchain you are using! We make no
/// stability or soundness guarantees regarding this cfg, and may remove it at
/// any point.
///
/// We are actively working with Rust to stabilize the necessary language
/// guarantees to support this in a forwards-compatible way, which will enable
/// us to remove the cfg gate. As part of this effort, we need to know how much
/// demand there is for this feature. If you would like to use `IntoBytes` on
/// unions, [please let us know][discussion].

/// # Analysis
///
/// *This section describes, roughly, the analysis performed by this derive to
/// determine whether it is sound to implement `IntoBytes` for a given type.
/// Unless you are modifying the implementation of this derive, or attempting to
/// manually implement `IntoBytes` for a type yourself, you don't need to read
/// this section.*
///
/// If a type has the following properties, then this derive can implement
/// `IntoBytes` for that type:
///
/// - If the type is a struct, its fields must be [`IntoBytes`]. Additionally:
///     - if the type is `repr(transparent)` or `repr(packed)`, it is
///       [`IntoBytes`] if its fields are [`IntoBytes`]; else,
///     - if the type is `repr(C)` with at most one field, it is [`IntoBytes`]
///       if its field is [`IntoBytes`]; else,
///     - if the type has no generic parameters, it is [`IntoBytes`] if the type
///       is sized and has no padding bytes; else,
///     - if the type is `repr(C)`, its fields must be [`Unaligned`].
/// - If the type is an enum:
///   - It must have a defined representation (`repr`s `C`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`,
///     `u64`, `usize`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, or `isize`).
///   - It must have no padding bytes.
///   - Its fields must be [`IntoBytes`].
///
/// This analysis is subject to change. Unsafe code may *only* rely on the
/// documented [safety conditions] of `FromBytes`, and must *not* rely on the
/// implementation details of this derive.
