// those terms.

// ON THE PRELUDE: All of the tests in this directory (excepting UI tests)
// disable the prelude via `#![no_implicit_prelude]`. This ensures that all code
// emitted by our derives doesn't accidentally assume that the prelude is
// included, which helps ensure that items are referred to by absolute path,
// which in turn ensures that these items can't accidentally refer to names
// which have been shadowed. For example, the code `x == None` could behave
// incorrectly if, in the scope in which the derive is invoked, `None` has been
// shadowed by `CONST None: Option<usize> = Some(1)`.
//
// `mod imp` allows us to import items and refer to them in this module without
// introducing the risk that this hides bugs in which derive-emitted code uses
// names which are not fully-qualified. For such a bug to manifest, it would
// need to be of the form `imp::Foo`, which is unlikely to happen by accident.

    // Since this file is included in every test file, and since not every test
    // file uses every item here, we allow unused imports to avoid generating
    // warnings.
