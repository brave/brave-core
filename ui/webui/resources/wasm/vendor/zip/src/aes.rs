//! Implementation of the AES decryption for zip files.
//!
//! This was implemented according to the [WinZip specification](https://www.winzip.com/win/en/aes_info.html).
//! Note that using CRC with AES depends on the used encryption specification, AE-1 or AE-2.
//! If the file is marked as encrypted with AE-2 the CRC field is ignored, even if it isn't set to 0.
