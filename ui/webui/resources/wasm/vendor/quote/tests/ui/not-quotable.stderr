  |             the trait `ToTokens` is not implemented for `Ipv4Addr`
  |             required by a bound introduced by this call

  = help: the following other types implement trait `ToTokens`:
            &T
            &mut T
            Box<T>
            CStr
            CString
            Cow<'a, T>
            Option<T>
            Rc<T>
          and $N others
