Traits which describe the functionality of [password hashing algorithms].

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

Provides a `no_std`-friendly implementation of the
[Password Hashing Competition (PHC) string format specification][PHC]
(a well-defined subset of the [Modular Crypt Format a.k.a. MCF][MCF]) which
works in conjunction with the traits this crate defines.

## Supported Crates

See [RustCrypto/password-hashes] for algorithm implementations which use
this crate for interoperability:

- [`argon2`] - Argon2 memory hard key derivation function
- [`pbkdf2`] - Password-Based Key Derivation Function v2
- [`scrypt`] - scrypt key derivation function

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.60** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version may be changed in the future, but it will be
accompanied by a minor version bump.

## SemVer Policy

- All on-by-default features of this library are covered by SemVer
- MSRV is considered exempt from SemVer as noted above
