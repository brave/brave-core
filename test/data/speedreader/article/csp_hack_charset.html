        <p>This page is copied from
          https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/06/encrypt-web-https-everywhere-firefox-extension, with modification. Today
          EFF and the Tor Project are launching a public beta of a new Firefox extension called
          <a href="https://eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a>.
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://a.test/should_fail.png" border="0" alt="This image is not loaded"
            name="click here to encrypt the web" id="click here to encrypt the web" /></p>
        <p>This Firefox extension was inspired by the launch of Google's <a
            href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/05/google-launches-encrypted-search">encrypted
            search option</a>. We wanted a way to ensure that every search our browsers sent was
          encrypted. At the same time, we were also able to encrypt most or all of the browser's
          communications with some other sites:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google Search</li>
          <li>Wikipedia</li>
          <li>Twitter and Identi.ca</li>
          <li>Facebook</li>
          <li>EFF and Tor</li>
          <li>Ixquick, DuckDuckGo, Scroogle and other small search engines</li>
          <li>and lots more!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Firefox users can install HTTPS Everywhere by following <a
            href="https://www.eff.org/files/https-everywhere-latest.xpi">this link</a>. As always,
          even if you're at an HTTPS page, remember that unless Firefox displays a colored address bar
          and an unbroken lock icon in the bottom-right corner, the page is not completely encrypted
          and you may still be vulnerable to various forms of eavesdropping or hacking (in many cases,
          HTTPS Everywhere can't prevent this because sites incorporate insecure third-party content).
