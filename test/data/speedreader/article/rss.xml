<p>When a lifelong dream is finally reached, it&#8217;s something good. And a woman from Euless is still celebrating that big moment.</p>



<p>Margarita Trevino walked across the stage and proudly received her paralegal certificate from the Center for Advanced legal Studies in Houston on Saturday.</p>



<p>Earning that diploma has always been in the back in her mind. As a child, she wanted to study or work in law.<br>Life took her in other directions. She went into cosmetology after high school, then became a mom.</p>



<p>When the pandemic hit, Trevino created a bucket list and reached back to that dream about going to college to get into the legal field.</p>



<p>Now after more than 35 years in cosmetology, two kids raised and now a grandmother, Trevino has her paralegal certificate and hopes to enroll next semester to get her associates of applied science.</p>



<p>Her daughter Nataly tells us, &#8220;I&#8217;m so proud of her. She set her mind on something and did not let anything hold her back. She is one of the strongest people I know.&#8221;</p>



<p>Let us know when you see something good. Send pictures and information to isee@nbcdfw.com.</p>

<p>Heavy rain led to flash flooding in Dallas, leaving some drivers stranded and others fleeing their cars as high water swept them off the road.</p>



<p>Dallas police worked to rescue stranded drivers after several vehicles were partially submerged at Cesar Chavez and Interstate 45 in Dallas.</p>



<p>One man was seen sitting on the roof of his car until first responders could get him to safety. Another driver of a pickup truck that was almost completely submerged was also rescued, the water was up to their shoulders as they walked to safety.</p>



<p>Drivers were also rescued off Lemmon Avenue near Inwood where water floated several cars down the street.</p>



<p>Another hard-hit area was near Baylor Scott &amp; White&#8217;s emergency room near Hall and Worth Streets. Several drivers had to abandon their cars when fast-moving flood waters carried them.</p>



<p>&#8220;How scared was I? Baby, I almost drowned in this car, I had to kick this door open to get out of this car,&#8221; one woman told NBC 5&#8217;s Larry Collins.</p>



<p>Another woman and her kids had to get out of their car when water started floating her car and she said it was as high as her driver&#8217;s side window.</p>



<p>NBC 5 meteorologist Grant Johnston said many areas of Dallas received more than eight inches of rain in the past 24 hours and more torrential rain is expected to add to those rain totals.</p>







<p>The Dallas police department took to Twitter to urge drivers to stay off the road.</p>

<p>Heavy rain brought flash flooding to North Texas, in Fort Worth some five inches of rain fell overnight leading to flooding in some neighborhoods Monday morning.</p>



<p>In the Linwood neighborhood off West 7th Street, high water made travel treacherous. </p>



<p>Cars could be seen driving through high water at the intersection of Crockett and Norwood, an area known to flood in heavy rain.</p>







<p>Authorities remind everyone to turn and not drive through standing water.</p>



<p>Neighbors just north of West 7th near the intersection of Hamilton Avenue at Templeton Drive told NBC 5 they spent the night working together trying to sweep flood water out of their homes.</p>



<p>&#8220;It started coming through at like what 10? And we couldn&#8217;t stop it we put towels down barriers overtook our entire living room,&#8221;  said Nicole, who didn&#8217;t want her last name used. She had to help a neighbor with flooding. &#8220;So we tried to clean his out because we share walls and his is even worse.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Fort Worth Police Department reported water got into the property room where they store evidence.</p>



<p>The building off Lancaster near Camp Bowie was evacuated for a short time but has since reopened and damage is being assessed.</p>



<p>And it wasn&#8217;t just rain, in a neighborhood near State Highway 183 and Vickery Boulevard, neighbors say lightning may have started a house fire.</p>

<p>Charles Cato has been selected as the new chief of police at Dallas Area Rapid Transit, commonly known as DART, the department announced in a press release.</p>



<p>Cato will direct and oversee the DART Police Department including officers, security services and related functions in the transit&#8217;s daily operations. He will lead a team of over 250 licensed officers, 110 fare enforcement officers and 67 support staff.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are very excited to welcome a compassionate leader and true public servant like Chief Cato to the DART team,&#8221; Nadine S. Lee, DART president and CEO, said. &#8220;His exemplary background in law enforcement as well as his experience in developing and expanding cross-agency collaborations provides our police department and the entire agency fresh perspective for enhancing security in the transit system as we continue to serve the residents of the North Texas region.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cato joins the department from the City of Mesquite where he served as the chief of police there. Prior to that role, he was the first assistant chief of police at the Dallas Police Department.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am honored to be entrusted with the opportunity to lead the dedicated women and men of the DART Police Department,&#8221; Cato said. &#8220;I look forward to continuing the DART police department&#8217;s community-oriented policing efforts so that we can build and expand on the strong bonds we have developed with both our service area cities as well as the citizens we serve.&#8221;</p>



<p>Chief Cato will assume his role on Sept. 6, 2022.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>National Fentanyl Awareness Day is on Sunday, Aug. 21. Across the country, communities rallied to shine a light on a problem plaguing countless families. </p>



<p>In Flower Mound, teens and their parents gathered to gain understanding about the deadly drug and tools to hopefully avoid tragedy. </p>



<p>It was the pain of her own loss that moved Kathy O’Keefe to action. When her son died of a drug overdose twelve years ago, fentanyl wasn’t on the radar. Today, the drug has infiltrated communities with deadly consequences.</p>



<p>“I want people to understand it can happen to you. It does happen in Flower Mound. It does happen to good families that go to church and are close,&#8221; O&#8217;Keefe said. &#8220;It can happen.”</p>



<p>O’Keefe hosted a panel discussion at Flower Mound High School where law enforcement said they’ve seen an increase in fentanyl over the last eighteen months. Eduardo Chavez is a special agent in charge of the Dallas Drug Enforcement Administration and was a part of Sunday’s panel.</p>

<p>“Ask that question. Make it uncomfortable,” said Chaves. &#8220;Because people&#8217;s lives depend on it.”</p>



<p>He said in the DFW region last year, the Dallas DEA seized more than 600,000 pills containing fentanyl. This year, they’re on track to double that number.</p>



<p>“That is alarming, only because there is no experimentation when it comes to fentanyl,” Chaves said. “Two milligrams are a lethal dose.”</p>



<p>According to the United States DEA, fentanyl is about 100 times more potent than morphine. NARCAN was available to families in Flower Mound as a life-saving measure in the event of an overdose.</p>



<p>“It takes hard conversations at home. It takes not avoiding that elephant in the room,” said Chaves.</p>



<p>On National Fentanyl Awareness Day and beyond, O’Keefe said her hope is that less families experience what hers has.</p>



<p>“It’s so important for us to open those doors,” she said. “Make people pay attention.”</p>

<p>Hany Mukhtar scored twice in the first half and Nashville SC rolled to a 4-0 victory over FC Dallas on Sunday.</p>



<p>It took Mukhtar just five minutes to find the net for the first time. Jacob Shaffelburg stretched the lead to 2-0 with a goal — his first of the season — in the 26th minute and Mukhtar notched his brace in the 33rd to send Nashville (9-9-9) into halftime with a 3-0 lead.</p>



<p>Mukhtar is second in the league with 16 goals this season, two behind Austin FC’s Sebastián Driussi in the race for the Golden Boot.</p>



<p>Dave Romney capped the scoring for Nashville in the 72nd minute with his third goal.</p>



<p>Joe Willis never faced a shot on goal in posting a clean sheet for Nashville. Maarten Paes had four saves for Dallas (11-8-9).</p>



<p>Nashville came in having lost two straight at home for the first time in club history. The team is 2-4-2 in its last eight home matches after losing just twice in its first 35 (including playoffs).</p>

<p>Kayla Thornton scored 20 points and Teaira McCowan had 17 points and 11 rebounds to help the Dallas Wings beat the Connecticut Sun 89-79 on Sunday in Game 2 of the best-of-three series and avoid elimination.</p>



<p>The sixth-seeded Wings, who will host Wednesday’s Game 3, never trailed en route to winning the franchise’s first playoff game since 2009. They led by double digits for the final 26-plus minutes, despite a 22-2 fourth-quarter run that trimmed a 31-point Sun deficit to 84-73 with less than 2 minutes left.</p>



<p>“I think we have to learn how to capitalize,” McCowan said. “With us being a young team, you know, sometimes we get a little sloppy — as you could see at the end. But, I mean, once we tighten that up, it’ll be good for the next game.”</p>



<p>Allisha Gray had 15 points, eight assists and three steals for the Wings, and Marina Mabrey scored 14 points.</p>



<p>Jonquel Jones had 20 points and nine rebounds for third-seeded Connecticut and Brionna Jones also scored 20. DiJonai Carrington added 13 points.</p>



<p>“I knew I had to go in and do what I do best, which is rebound, be a dominant force inside, and that’s what I did tonight for my teammates,” said McCowan, who had seven points and five rebounds in Game 1.</p>



<p>“We have to put our talent to work. I mean, we know what we can do. We have great players on our team so if everyone plays their role, plays team offense and defense, we’ll be fine.</p>



<p>Dallas shot 48% (36 of 75) from the field, made 11 of 26 (42.3%) from 3-point range and finished with 28 assists.</p>

<p>Marcus Semien and Nathaniel Lowe homered, Kohei Arihara pitched a career-high six innings and combined with Taylor Hearn for the shutout, and the Texas Rangers beat the Minnesota Twins 7-0 on Sunday.</p>



<p>Minnesota starter Joe Ryan held Texas hitless for the first three innings before Semien led off the fourth with his 19th home run of the season. Semien drove in three runs.</p>



<p>Adolis García extended his hitting streak to 18 games, the longest current streak in the majors.</p>



<p>The Rangers won for the third time in four games following a week of dramatic changes. The team fired fourth-year manager Chris Woodward on Monday. President of baseball operations Jon Daniels was fired on Wednesday.</p>



<p>“It’s almost like a clean slate with (interim manager Tony) Beasley,” Semien said of last week’s organizational changes. “When that stuff happened, it just kind of wakes the room up. It’s unfortunate what happened last week, but it wakes the room up and puts everyone on notice that we need to get our stuff together and start playing better.”</p>



<p>Arihara (1-1) was impressive in just his second major league start of the season. The right-hander from Japan spent most of the season at Triple-A Round Rock. He gave up four hits and pitched into the seventh inning.</p>



<p>“I was definitely more settled in this time, more relaxed and got into a rhythm quickly,” Arihara said through a translator.</p>



<p>Taylor Hearn came on in relief after the first two batters of the seventh singled off Arihara. Hearn retired three in a row to end the threat and finished off the final three innings for his first career save.</p>



<p>“We pitched outstanding,” Beasley said. “Kohei, he set the tone for us. I always say that pitching is the face of the game. So, he set the tone. He kept us at bay. If he comes out and doesn’t pitch well, none of this offense matters. So, he kept the game in a spot where we had a chance to get going offensively.”</p>



<p>Ryan (9-6) allowed just two hits and two runs, but he walked three and was done after 6 1/3 innings when Texas put together a three-run inning off Ryan and reliever Trevor Megill.</p>



<p>The Twins were shut out for the 11th time this season and now trail Cleveland by 1.5 games in the American League Central.</p>



<p>“We expected more from our offense,” Minnesota manager Rocco Baldelli said. “And will expect more going forward, a lot more. It was a day where there wasn’t much to even talk about. I think we rolled over on a lot of pitches. And it’s something I think we could have and should have been ready for. And I think we prepared for the type of pitcher we were facing today. The execution in the batter’s box has to be better.”</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Angela Perkins is on a mission straight from the heart.&nbsp;She almost lost her life on July 9, 2013, when she went into cardiac arrest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was at work in a meeting, just a routine meeting at work, and all of a sudden I collapsed and went into sudden cardiac arrest,” said Perkins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Someone called 911 and before co-workers could perform CPR,&nbsp;Dallas Fire Rescue arrived within minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over the next 20 minutes they continued CPR, and [shocked] me multiple times with an AED trying to get my heart started back,” said Perkins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Ann Marie Navar, Associate Professor of Cardiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center and Parkland, said people don’t always jump in because of concerns over inappropriate touching, injuring a person or COVID-19.&nbsp;Not enough people rush to help because of these fears, or simply not knowing how to perform CPR.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s important for people to get training in bystander CPR because you learn where to put your hands to get adequate chest compressions, but proper training can also protect you in the event of another outbreak, like COVID-19 for example,” said Dr. Navar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The North Texas division of the <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/affiliates/texas/dallas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Heart Association</a> trained over 55,000 people in bystander CPR last year.</p>



<p>“Start compressions as quickly as possible, and you want to do them hard and fast. We’re looking for between 100 and 120 compressions a minute,” said Dr. Navar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Dr. Navar and Perkins will be at this year’s American Heart Association annual heart walk.&nbsp;It’s a full-circle journey for Perkins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This will be my ninth walk to participate in. My first heart walk was actually in 2013. Just six weeks after I got out of the hospital. I’d already planned to walk before my cardiac arrest, which is pretty neat,” said Perkins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Navar says heart disease is the number one cause of death of women and men in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The heart walks for DFW take place Sept. 24 in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www2.heart.org/site/TR/HeartWalk/SWA-SouthWestAffiliate?pg=entry&amp;fr_id=7021" target="_blank">Dallas at Reunion Tower Lawn</a> and in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www2.heart.org/site/TR/HeartWalk/SWA-SouthWestAffiliate?pg=entry&amp;fr_id=7167" target="_blank">Tarrant County at The Shops at Clearfork</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A 26-year-old man is dead and one other is injured after an early Sunday morning shooting in Deep Ellum, Dallas police confirm to NBC 5. </p>



<p>Officers responded at 2:55 a.m. Sunday morning to a shooting in the 2600 block of Elm Street. Upon arrival, Dallas police found a man lying on the ground with a gunshot wound to the chest and another man around the corner who was shot in the leg.</p>



<p>Ricky Burns, 26, died at the scene and another victim, also 26, was treated at a nearby hospital. A Dallas police investigation determined Burns and an unknown Latin male, between 20-30 years old, were arguing. Both men attempted to pull weapons from their waistbands when the unknown suspect shot Burns and the other victim.</p>



<p>The unidentified suspect ran from the scene and is still at large. Police are asking that those who have information call Detective Andrea Isom with Dallas&#8217; Homicide Unit at 214-671-3701.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>According to the U.S Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Nothern District of Texas, a Dallas lawyer has been sentenced to five years in federal prison for conspiring to launder money he believed was linked to narcotics trafficking.</p>



<p>52-year-old Rayshun Jackon of The Jackson Law Firm was arrested in April 2021and plead guilty to conspiracy to launder money in September 2021.</p>



<p>Mr. Jackson admitted to laundering $380,000 for an individual he believed was a drug trafficker, but was actually an undercover DEA agent, according to the plea papers.</p>



<p>He was introduced to the agent on Sept. 3, 2020, by &#8220;Person A,&#8221; the leader of a large-scale opioid distribution ring known to deal in illegally diverted narcotics. After Person A vouched for the undercover agent&#8217;s credibility, Mr. Jackson and the undercover agent talked about how the attorney could &#8220;clean&#8221; the agent&#8217;s &#8220;dope money.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mr. Jackson advised the agent that he could launder around $500,000 a month by funneling it through non-traceable cash businesses (i.e., coin laundries, car washes) and shell corporations.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ray is the bomb. He&#8217;s a thug, he&#8217;s just got a law degree,&#8221; Person A told the undercover agent after the meeting, according to court documents.</p>



<p>The undercover agent delivered a black backpack filled with $100,000 cash to Mr. Jackson at his office just three weeks later. Jackson agreed to launder the money for a 4% fee and a 1% bonus in cash upfront. After depositing the remaining $95,000 into various firm bank accounts in various amounts on various days, he eventually transferred the entire sum into the DEA&#8217;s undercover bank account.</p>



<p>The following month, the undercover agent delivered an additional $300,000 cash to Mr. Jackson at his office with the same fees as before for laundering the money. After depositing the remaining $285,000 into his various firm bank accounts in various amounts on various days, he eventually transferred the same amount into the DEA&#8217;s undercover bank account.</p>



<p>Mr. Jackson admitted to knowing of the unlawful purpose of the agreement and joined in it willingly, according to plea papers.</p>



<p>&#8220;The sentencing of Rayshun Jackson marks the end of a successful investigation by DEA Dallas. Criminal drug organizations need a combination of individuals who are willing to distribute drugs as well as those who hide and attempt to legitimize profits,&#8221; said DEA Dallas Special Agent in Charge, Eduardo A. Chávez. &#8220;Mr. Jackson agreed to launder what he believed to be drug proceeds with DEA undercover. The sentencing of Mr. Jackson is just. With overdose deaths and poisonings reaching record highs, everyone will be held accountable for their criminal actions.&#8221;</p>



<p>During the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor told the court that a five-year sentence would reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Individuals such as Mr. Jackson, who use money laundering methods to conceal the true source of illegal drug profits, run the risk of serving jail time,&#8221; said Christopher J. Altemus, Jr., Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation Dallas Field Office. &#8220;The sentence imposed by the court is a reminder to criminals that money laundering schemes will be vigorously investigated and prosecuted. IRS-CI special agents are proud to work hand-in-hand with our law enforcement partners to bring criminals like Mr. Jackson to justice.&#8221;</p>



<p>The investigation was conducted by The Drug Enforcement Administration&#8217;s Dallas Field Office and IRS &#8211; Criminal Investigations along with the Dallas Police Department.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>KaVontae Turpin is making the most of his first chance to make a National Football League roster.</p>



<p>The Dallas wide receiver became the first player in nine seasons to have kickoff and punt return touchdowns in the same game, leading the Cowboys to a 32-18 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers on Saturday night.</p>







<p>&#8220;My body&#8217;s still wild, but I&#8217;m still here trying to focus. I got this big opportunity, so I can&#8217;t really complain about it. I work through it,&#8221; Turpin said.</p>



<p>Turpin signed with the Cowboys on July 28 after garnering MVP honors in the United States Football League this past spring. Before Turpin, the last player to run back a punt and kickoff in the same game &#8212; preseason, regular season or playoffs &#8212; was Detroit&#8217;s Jeremy Ross on Dec. 8, 2013, against Philadelphia.</p>



<p>Coach Mike McCarthy said he has been impressed with Turpin since he has been in camp.</p>



<p>&#8220;Obviously, he had a very successful run there with the USFL, but really from the first day of practice, I mean, he came in and I was really impressed with the way he picked up the receiver play and the language,&#8221; McCarthy said. &#8220;But you can see he&#8217;s dynamic in the return game. Two excellent big plays set the tempo.&#8221;</p>



<p>Turpin had six special teams touchdowns during his collegiate career at TCU, but he was dismissed in 2018 when he was accused of assaulting his girlfriend. He was initially suspended but then kicked off the team because the school was unaware of a previous assault case in New Mexico. Turpin pleaded guilty in the Texas case with a chance to clear the conviction from his record and attended an abuse intervention program.</p>

<p>After going undrafted in 2019, Turpin played in the indoor Fan-Controlled Football League, the Spring League and the European League of Football for three years before signing with the USFL. As a member of the New Jersey Generals, he led the league in receiving yards and had the lone punt return for a TD.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a crazy year, you know. I&#8217;ve been playing football all year round, so I haven&#8217;t got a chance to get my body back,&#8221; Turpin said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just happy for this opportunity the Cowboys gave me after the USFL to come out here and show everybody what I can do, prove to myself I belong in this league.&#8221;</p>



<p>After a 22-yard field goal by Dustin Hopkins gave the Chargers a 3-0 lead midway through the first quarter, Turpin returned the ensuing kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown.</p>



<p>Turpin got a nice wall of blockers in the middle of the field before getting into open space near the 40 and going untouched up the right sideline.</p>



<p>Dallas had a 29-10 lead at halftime after a pair of touchdowns in the final minute of the second quarter. That included Turpin&#8217;s 86-yard punt return, where he eluded a tackle attempt from punt gunner Deane Leonard after fielding the ball, did a couple juke moves and then broke free for the score.</p>



<p>After two days of joint practices earlier in the week, both teams rested most of their starters. Dallas improved to 1-1 while the Chargers are 0-2.</p>



<p>Cooper Rush and Will Grier each directed first-half TD drives for the Cowboys, while Rico Dowdle and Malik Davis each had rushing scores. Dowdle finished as the game&#8217;s leading rusher with 44 yards on 13 carries.</p>



<p>Easton Stick played the first half for the Chargers and connected with Joshua Palmer on a wide receiver screen for an 18-yard touchdown early in the second quarter to give the Chargers a short-lived 10-7 advantage. Palmer finished with three receptions for 75 yards.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was a really poor first half for us, about as poorly as you can play, and that really put us behind, overall,&#8221; Chargers coach Brandon Staley said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t like the way that that first half felt or looked. It was really in all three phases. When you have two turnovers and you give up two special teams touchdowns, that&#8217;s the way the score is going to look.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">LATE SCORE</h2>



<p>Chargers&#8217; wide receiver Michael Bandy had eight catches for 69 yards, including a 1-yard TD late in the fourth quarter.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">INJURIES</h2>



<p>Chargers: RB Isaiah Spiller suffered an ankle injury during the second half and did not return.</p>

<p>Corey Seager hit a go-ahead single in the 10th inning and Mark Mathias added an RBI in the frame, leading the Texas Rangers to a 4-3 win over the Minnesota Twins on Saturday night.</p>



<p>Seager’s hit-off Twins reliever Caleb Thielbar (2-2) drove in Marcus Semien, who was the automatic runner at second base. Mathias later drove in Seager with a single to center off Griffin Jax.</p>



<p>Minnesota scored a run in the 10th after reliever Jonathan Hernández (1-0) couldn’t handle a slow roller off the bat of Max Kepler. But Jose Miranda flew out one batter later to end the game with runners on the corners.</p>



<p>Texas improved to 8-25 in one-run games. Interim manager Tony Beasley is 3-3 since replacing Chris Woodward.</p>



<p>Right-hander Glenn Otto put together a strong start for Texas, allowing one unearned run on three hits in 5 2/3 innings. Chris Archer also allowed one run on three hits for Minnesota in five innings.</p>



<p>Miranda, Minnesota’s talented rookie, tied the game in the eighth with a single to center that scored Kepler from first base for his 53rd RBI of the season.</p>



<p>Rangers right fielder Adolis Garcia had two hits and extended his hitting streak to 17 games.</p>



<p>Ezequiel Duran delivered a go-ahead single in the top of the sixth to put the Rangers up 2-1. The hit came after the Twins challenged a call on a pickoff move to first base that stood after review.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Saturday marked one week since a disagreement between coaches at a little <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/community-organizations-rally-together-after-the-death-of-lancaster-youth-football-coach/3052103/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">league football game turned deadly</a>, leaving coach Michael Hickmon dead.</p>



<p>Following calls for change, coaches, parents and the community came together to come up with a plan to end senseless violence at youth sports events.</p>



<p>“All of us are Mike Hickmon. I could’ve been Mike Hickmon that day. That could’ve happened to me,” said Leneric Edwards, who knew Hickmon personally.</p>



<p>“He was very conscious of how other people felt. He was a very good guy,” he said.</p>



<p>Edwards also coached Hickmon’s son in track and attended the town hall to be part of the prevention process moving forward.</p>

<p>“A lot of times when something happens, people lose sight or vision,” said Edwards.</p>



<p>Instead, those who were present focused on what can be done today. That included the formation of a coalition of parents and staff to develop a code of conduct along with enhancing qualifications for coaching staff, moving games to school grounds where rules can be better enforced, and in some cases, employing sheriff’s deputies to stand on the sidelines.</p>



<p>They also pledged to communicate better with each other to keep so-called bad actors out of their organizations and off of their fields.</p>

<p>Chin Shin, who everyone knew as Jin, was shot early Monday morning in Fort Worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It happened after a traffic accident led to an argument and eventually, gunfire at the intersection of the southbound lanes of South University Drive and Interstate 30.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s been a roller coaster for everybody, going through this in the last several days, but it’s been a very powerful experience to see what he has built in terms of community,” said friend Conrad Alagaban.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shin&#8217;s sister and close friends spoke highly of him and his business, Family Karaoke, where they also credited his singing talents.</p>



<p>“He loved karaoke, he loved singing. In fact, if you couldn’t figure out what to do on a particular night that he’s available, his first suggestion is to go karaoke,” said longtime friend Jack Chang.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shin&#8217;s family moved from South Korea and planted roots in Dallas when he was young.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shin was known for his acts of kindness, donating money to the shooting victims of the <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/gunman-possibly-targeting-asian-owned-businesses-in-dallas-police-say/2967716/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Korean-owned hair salon, Hair World</a>.&nbsp;</p>

AND HE IS STILL ON THE RUN. THIS COMES AFTER WEDNESDAY&#039;S SHOOTING AT AN \&quot;A\&quot; NORTHWEST DALLAS HAIR SALON. A MAN WALKED IN AND OPENED FIRE, INJURING THREE WOMEN. POLICE NOW SAY TWO OTHER CRIMES MAY BE CONNECTED. LET&#039;S WALK YOU THROUGH THE TIME LINE. ON APRIL 2nd A SHOOTER OPENED FIRE ON THREE BUSINESSES. AT A STRIP MALL ON ROYAL LANE. THIS TUESDAY THERE WAS A SHOOTING AT A BUSINESS ON SUNNYVALE STREET IN SOUTHERN DALLAS. NO ONE WAS HURT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING AT A SALON ON ROYAL LANE. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SUSPECT&#039;S VEHICLE IS SIMILAR. DALLAS POLICE NOW BELIEVE THESE MAY BE HATE CRIMES AND THEY NEED HELP TO GET THIS GUY OFF THE STREET. MEREDITH YEOMANS HAS THE LATEST ON THE INVESTIGATION AND NEW REACTION FROM THE COMMUNITY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: NONE OF THEM ARE HERE. KOREA TOWN IS A DALLAS DESTINATION. TODAY WE LEARNED IT MAY ALSO BE A TARGET. &gt;&gt; THE COMMUNITY IS VERY CONCERNED AND ON EDGE ASK VERY NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT&#039;S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AFTER THREE SHOOTINGS, DALLAS POLICE SAY TWO HAVE BEEN IN THIS COMMUNITY, ONCE WHEN A DRIVE-BY SHOOTER OPENED FIRE ON THREE BUSINESSES IN A STRIP MALL LAST MONTH, THEN ANOTHER WEDNESDAY AT HAIR WORLD SALON WHEN THIS SUSPECT WALKED IN AND SHOT THREE WOMEN. DALLAS POLICE CHIEF EDDIE GARCIA ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT ALL THREE SHOOTINGS MAY BE CONNECTED AND THAT HATE MAY BE THE MOTIVATION. &gt;&gt; WE&#039;RE TURNING TO EVERY RESIDENT TO KEEP AN EYE OUT.

MEREDITH YEOMANS, NBC 5. &gt;&gt; DALLAS MAYOR ERIC JOHNSON RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING THE CITY STANDS WITH THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. HE SAYS, QUOTE, HATE HAS NO PLACE IN OUR CITY. &gt;&gt;&gt; SADLY THIS IS AN ISSUE WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR A GUNMAN TARGETED ATLANTA-AREA SPAS, KILLING EIGHT PEOPLE AND MANY OF THEM WERE OF ASIAN DESCENT. IT CALLED ATTENTION TO THE GROWING AMOUNT OF HIT INCIDENTS AGAINST THE ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES AND THEY HAVE GONE UP SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. FROM THE SPRING OF 2020 TO THE END OF LAST YEAR, NEARLY 11,000 HATE INCIDENTS WERE REPORTED TO THE ADVOCATES GROUP STOP AAPI HATE THAT. GROUP SAYS THE BEST WAY TO COMBAT THIS HATE IS TO REPORT IT RIGHT AWAY AND TO GET ENGAGED WITH WHAT&#039;S HAPPENING. YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING TO HELP&quot;,&quot;video_id&quot;:&quot;2033045059620_286&quot;,&quot;video_length&quot;:&quot;202936&quot;,&quot;video_provider&quot;:&quot;mpx&quot;,&quot;short_video_excerpt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;mpx_download_pid_mobile_low&quot;:&quot;_7J7sQZsvwJV&quot;,&quot;pid_streaming_web_mobile_low&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;mpx_download_pid_mobile_standard&quot;:&quot;PgLoJblLTLcR&quot;,&quot;pid_streaming_mobile_standard&quot;:&quot;SkhYUA9WZrab&quot;,&quot;alleypack_schedule_unpublish&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;feed_remote_id&quot;:&quot;mpx_2033045059620&quot;,&quot;feed_thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-livestream="false" data-title="Gunman Possibly Targeting Asian-Owned Businesses in Dallas, Police Say" data-vidcid="1:8:2968064" data-vidurl="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/gunman-possibly-targeting-asian-owned-businesses-in-dallas-police-say-2/2968064/" data-islead="false" data-catnames="{&quot;329284&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;1098&quot;:&quot;Local&quot;,&quot;1166&quot;:&quot;U.S. &amp;amp; World&quot;}" data-tagnames="{&quot;140&quot;:&quot;Dallas&quot;,&quot;354947&quot;:&quot;dallas crime&quot;,&quot;169&quot;:&quot;Dallas Police&quot;,&quot;487891&quot;:&quot;dallas shooting&quot;}" data-customdata="{&quot;ContentPartner&quot;:&quot;None&quot;,&quot;Source&quot;:&quot;WEBFM&quot;,&quot;SyndicationAllowed&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;mSNVideoCategories&quot;:&quot;MSN Video v4 Connector-most watched news&quot;,&quot;mSNVideoContentSupplierID&quot;:&quot;NBC_Local&quot;,&quot;mSNVideoCountry&quot;:&quot;us&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;nosubtitle&quot;,&quot;uploadedByTeam&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;youtubeChannel&quot;:&quot;None&quot;}" data-autoplay="false" data-cplay="true"></div>



<p>He also worked tirelessly helping other businesses, his community, and especially his family during the height of the pandemic.</p>



<p>“I am an ICU nurse, and I remember he was really concerned about me. He gathered a bunch of people including my mom, and they all made masks and he brought it all up to the hospital,&#8221; said younger sister Kerri Shin Mejia. &#8220;Those are the kinds of things he does. He didn’t tell me he was doing it. He just showed that he loved me.&#8221;</p>



<p>She is still in shock at how an argument after an accident escalated to violence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This should never happen to anyone. A fender bender should never turn into this. I believe the detectives are going to do what they need to do and I know the truth is going to come out,” said Shin Mejia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this time, Fort Worth police have made no arrests, the department confirmed.</p>



<p>There are fundraising efforts to help his daughter and his family with funeral expenses.</p>

<p>“Initially, we were not able to meet the demands because of the shortage of vaccinations. After the change in the dosage and administration, now we’re able to meet that. So, now I’m excited to be able to provide to everybody that wants the vaccine,” she said. “Monkeypox can affect anyone. There are cases among CIS gender women, heterosexual men, and children in fact now.”</p>



<p>Waylan Keim was in Dallas on Saturday for a concert and said he has had trouble finding vaccine availability in Austin, where he lives.</p>

THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT VACCINE EQUITY, MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THESE RISK GROUPS WERE ABLE TO GET VACCINATED IF THEY NEEDED TO. THIS BEING A COMMUNITY-BASED CLINIC, THEY SAY, THERE&#039;S A LEVEL OF TRUST FOR PEOPLE TO GO THERE RATHER THAN A HEALTH CLINIC. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE FEELING LIKE, WIPING THE SWEAT OFF THEIR BROWS AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS AND CONCERNED. THIS IS -- I MEAN, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT VACCINE HESITANCY AND ALL THOSE THINGS. WE&#039;RE JUST NOT SEEING THAT WITH MONKEYPOX.

<p>DeSoto police are investigating the fatal shooting of a security guard at a lounge on Friday night, officials said. </p>



<p>According to the DeSoto Police Department, officers responded to a call at the Brickhouse Lounge in the 2000 block of North Hampton Road at approximately 10 p.m. </p>



<p>Police said when officers arrived, they found that the establishment&#8217;s security guard, 47-year-old Derek Phillips of Arlington, had been shot multiple times. </p>



<p>Officers and responding paramedics provided emergency first aid at the scene, and the victim was transported to a local hospital where he was later pronounced dead, police said.</p>



<p>According to police, security tapes and witnesses confirmed that a lounge patron, 48-year-old Toussel Kuhn of Savannah, Texas, had been arguing with Phillips over lounge rules prior to the shooting.</p>



<p>Police said the altercation escalated, at which point Kuhn shot Phillips.</p>



<p>Kuhn was reportedly wounded by a bystander during the incident, and he fled the scene in a vehicle before crashing in Glenn Heights, police said. </p>



<p>According to DeSoto police, Glenn Heights officers were dispatched to the scene and determined that Kuhn was wanted by DeSoto Police in connection to the lounge shooting. </p>



<p>Police said Kuhn was taken to a local hospital for treatment and is now in custody for the security guard&#8217;s murder.</p>

<p>That area includes the Mexican border city of Matamoros and Brownsville, Texas.</p>



<p>The disturbance was moving northwest at 13 mph, and could become a tropical storm before hitting land late Saturday.</p>



<p>The system had winds reaching near 35 mph.</p>



<p>Tropical storm warnings have been issued for a stretch of the lower Texas Gulf Coast and part of Mexico’s northeast shoreline.</p>



<p>Mexico’s government issued a tropical storm warning for its Gulf coast from Boca de Catan north to the mouth of the Rio Grande. A tropical storm warning also was in effect for the lower Texas coast from Port Mansfield south to the mouth of the Rio Grande.</p>



<p>Forecasters said the storm could produce total rain of 3 to 6 inches with isolated totals 8 inches along parts of Mexico’s eastern coast.</p>



<p>Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches with isolated higher amounts were possible across far south Texas, the hurricane center advisory said. It said the rainfall may produce life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides.</p>

<p>According to numbers recently released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Texas added 80,300 jobs in July.</p>



<p>The Texas Employment Forecast estimates show that there will be a 5.2 percent increase in jobs in 2022, with an 80 percent confidence band of 4.5 to 5.8 percent. This estimate is higher than last month&#8217;s projection of 4.5 percent.</p>



<p>&#8220;Texas employment continued to grow at a very strong rate, only moderating slightly from June&#8217;s pace and bringing year-to-date job growth to a very robust 6.1 percent,&#8221; said Christopher Slijk, Dallas Fed associate economist. &#8220;Expansion in July continued to be broad-based across industries and major metro areas, with Fort Worth and Austin leading growth in the state. However, we expect employment for the remainder of the year to decelerate to under 4 percent as forward-looking indicators for production and hiring point to a slowing in the state economy.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Additional key takeaways from the latest Dallas Fed report:</h2>



<ul><li>The forecast suggests that 674,200 jobs will be added in the state this year, and employment in December 2022 will be 13.7 million</li><li>Texas employment grew an annualized 7.4 percent in July after increasing a revised 8.2 percent in June.</li><li>Among Texas&#8217; major metro areas, unemployment rates in July increased in San Antonio, New Braunfels, Dallas, Plano, and Irving, according to seasonally adjusted numbers from the Dallas Fed.</li><li>The unemployment rate decreased in McAllen, Edinburg, and Mission and remained unchanged in Houston, The Woodlands, Sugar Land; Austin and Round Rock; El Paso, Fort Worth and Arlington, Brownsville, Harlingen, and Laredo.</li><li>The Texas unemployment rate declined from 4.1 percent in June to 4.0 percent in July.</li><li>Additional information about the Texas Employment Forecast, plus seasonally adjusted and benchmarked Texas jobs data and metro unemployment rates may be found on DallasFed.org.</li></ul>



<p>Texas added a revised 87,700 jobs in June. In total, the state has added 460,000 jobs year-to-date. </p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Ellis County officials announce that 39-year-old Jon Russell Whitson, of Waxahachie, has been sentenced to a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the promotion of child pornography. </p>



<p>Whitson was also convicted of ten counts of Possession of Child Pornography. </p>



<p>On Thursday, May 5, Instagram flagged Whitson&#8217;s account and sent a cyber tip to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children regarding an image of child pornography, along with a video that Whitson shared. Instagram disabled the account but Whitson created a new one within a month.</p>



<p>The information regarding the tip was sent to the Waxahachie Police Department a few weeks later and they began an investigation.</p>



<p>The Waxahachie Police Department served a search warrant on August 18 to Whitson&#8217;s resident, where investigators seized his phone for subsequent forensic testing and the Department of Homeland Security Investigations Division conducted the data extraction of Whitson&#8217;s phone.</p>



<p>According to Ellis County officials, the phone contained several images and videos of the sexual abuse of children. Due to graphic nature, only a few of those videos and images were shown to the jury.</p>



<p>The judge determined that Whitson would serve the 20-year sentence, followed by an additional 2-year sentence assessed by the jury. </p>



<p>District Attorney Ann Montgomery says her office will prosecute anyone who would promote or profit from child pornography.</p>



<p>&#8220;Each image of child sexual abuse represents a real child who was victimized. This child continues to be victimized every time an offender downloads, possesses, and trades these horrendous and vile images.&#8221;</p>



<p>After Whitson is released from prison, he will be placed on community supervision to serve out the rest of his sentence. He will be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. </p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, often knocks President Joe Biden for high inflation and a looming recession — a standard GOP argument going into the November elections.</p>



<p>But inflation is even worse in major Texas cities than across the nation as a whole. Government figures show inflation is 10.2% in the Houston area and 9.4% around Dallas, higher than the latest national average of 8.5%.</p>



<p>Abbott and other GOP leaders are making a paradoxical argument that the U.S. economy has slumped into a recession, but Republican-led parts of the country are still booming. Those officials are blaming Biden’s policies for sky-high gasoline and food prices, while taking credit for the job gains those same policies helped spur.</p>



<p>The Texas governor tweeted on July 28: “The U.S. economy is in a recession under Biden. Meanwhile, Texas was #1 in the nation for job growth in June &amp; more Texans have jobs today than ever before in our state’s history.”</p>



<p>The Associated Press found a familiar pattern in 15 Republican-led states in which governors on Twitter would praise job growth in their states, while senators would simultaneously say the national economy as a whole was crashing. These seemingly conflicting claims were also repeated in public remarks.</p>



<p>GOP leaders say state policies such as low tax rates and keeping business open during the pandemic helped to fuel hiring and investment. But their claims tend to ignore how job growth was also boosted by a historic injection of federal money that began in March 2020 and continued under Biden with last year’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.</p>



<p>Biden and his fellow Democrats have acknowledged the pain caused by inflation that hit a 40-year high this summer. But the president has stressed that the United States has avoided a recession because of the low 3.5% unemployment rate. He argues that global factors such as the pandemic, fragile supply chains and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused prices to jump — and that he’s meeting the public’s needs with the economic and climate package signed into law on Tuesday.</p>



<p>“Too often we hand the biggest microphone to the critics and the cynics who delight in declaring failure while those committed to making real progress do the hard work of governing,” Biden said in a swipe at the GOP.</p>



<p>Multiple surveys do show that voters have a sense of foreboding about the economy and that most people fault the president. Researchers said there’s not a lot of academic analyses to show why many voters seem willing to blame inflation on White House policies and give a pass to statehouses, as inflation had been low in recent decades and less of a factor in elections than jobs.</p>



<p>Andrew Reeves, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said most voters likely judge the local and national economies by different standards. When it comes to state and local officials, voters form opinions through what they observe in their daily lives. But they often gauge the national economy through hard numbers and political ideologies.</p>



<p>“The ‘national economy’ is this nebulous thing that none of us actually experiences,” Reeves said. “It’s an abstract concept. We may be more willing to let our partisanship shade how we see what is going on nationally. Joe Biden is well into his term, so the honeymoon is over and he owns this economy — whether his policies are directly responsible for it or not.”</p>



<p>Republican governors such as Florida’s Ron DeSantis and Georgia’s Brian Kemp are largely unscathed on inflation, even though consumer prices are significantly above the national average in both of those states. Inflation is 10.6% in the Miami area, 11.2% in Tampa and 11.5% in Atlanta.</p>



<p>What many voters in Republican states are hearing is an economic argument similar to what Biden has attempted on a national scale — that job growth and government finances are strong enough to insulate people from a downturn.</p>



<p>DeSantis dismissed Biden’s claims that the U.S. economy remains healthy, calling that “Orwellian doublespeak.” The governor said at Florida’s Airports Council conference on Aug. 1 that his state’s budget surplus could insulate it from a downturn.</p>



<p>“We’re not immune to the inflation, we’re not immune to the energy prices,” DeSantis said. “Because Florida has been open, because Florida has excelled economically, we’re in the position where we’re going to be able to meet those needs of the state regardless of what Uncle Joe throws at us from Washington, D.C.”</p>



<p>Job growth has been broad across the country. Data released Friday by the Bureau of Statistic s found that employment increased in 43 states and was essentially unchanged in seven states over the past 12 months.</p>



<p>But the bipartisan research group EIG analyzed job growth in the three major Republican states (Texas, Arizona and Florida) and the three major Democratic ones (California, Illinois and New York). It found that the GOP areas have fully recovered and exceeded their pandemic job totals, while the recovery has been slower in Democratic states.</p>



<p>What seems to be the much more overarching priority among voters is not jobs but inflation, said John Lettieri, EIG’s president and CEO. At a time of political polarization, it’s striking to him how fears about prices are crossing generational, class, regional and partisan lines.</p>



<p>“There is strong unanimity that the economy is an issue, inflation is the No. 1 problem and Biden is to blame,” Lettieri said. “This cuts across all the divides. All those different ways we slice up the electorate, they’re all responding to this to one degree or another in strong ways.”</p>



<p>Inflation appears to be an inescapable challenge for Biden, even as other issues such as abortion rights appear to be rallying Democratic voters. Republicans are able promote job gains to say why they would be better at leading the economy, without having to list, as Biden has stressed in speeches, their own policies for reducing consumer prices.</p>



<p>Gabriel Lenz, a political science professor at the University of California Los Angeles, said the “best measure of what voters are personally experiencing” is a metric known as real disposable personal income. That figure looks at how much money people have after adjusting for taxes and inflation. Its changes over the past two years mirror those of Democratic political fortunes.</p>



<p>When Biden signed pandemic relief into law in March 2021, people’s real disposable income climbed 28.7% from a year ago. The aid helped the economy recover while some notable economists warned it could also be inflationary. As prices rose over the past year and much of the aid expired, real disposable income has tumbled 3.5% over the past 12 months as a result.</p>



<p>Based on that number, Lenz concluded: “It’s no surprise that people are gloomy.”</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>According to the Dallas Police Department, the Special Investigations Unit is conducting a death in custody investigation after a man dies while police were attempting to arrest him.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, at about 12:18 p.m., the Dallas Police Gang Unit responded to a home in the 200 block of Starr Street after an anonymous tip of a wanted suspect and stolen vehicles.</p>



<p>Two officers went to the front of the house and attempted to contact the people inside, police say. The officers knocked on the front door and the suspect, Paublo Ramos, 53, opened the door, then immediately shut and locked it after seeing the officers.</p>



<p>According to Dallas PD, additional officers were requested at the scene and set up a perimeter around the location. Upon the arrival of other gang unit elements, everyone inside the home was asked to leave. The six people in the home left, except Ramos.</p>



<p>Other suspects in the house, 28-Year-Old Johnny Hernandez and 32-year-old Angel Marquez, both had warrants and were arrested. Hernadez was taken to Dallas County, while Marquez was taken to Bexar County.</p>



<p>Officers found a stolen vehicle that was in the process of being stripped of parts in the backyard, along with other vehicles on the property that appeared to be stolen. The Dallas Police Auto Theft Unit was contacted, which obtained a search warrant for the location.</p>



<p>Police say SWAT responded and tried to make contact with the suspect over the next few hours, asking him to come out of a hiding spot in the attic and surrender, via loudspeaker.</p>



<p>SWAT also deployed gas into the house, hoping to have Ramos exit but got no response.</p>



<p>At about 6:50 p.m., SWAT inserted a camera in the attic and located Romas who was unable to exit on his own, then cut a hole into the roof to remove him safely.</p>



<p>A SWAT doctor, along with Dallas Fire Rescue started administering medical aid, and Ramas was taken to a local hospital by DFR where he died at 7:53 p.m. An autopsy is being conducted by the Dallas Medical Examiner.</p>



<p>This incident is being investigated as a death in custody by the Dallas Special Investigations Unit and the District Attorney&#8217;s officer will conduct their own investigation.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>A Dallas County judge has blocked the eviction of a mother with young children from her Mesquite apartment.</p>



<p>It’s a temporary order while a judge determines whether an allegation of forgery against the original court that handled her eviction is valid.</p>



<p>Chantal Hardaway has lived at her apartment complex in Mesquite for three years. She said paid her rent but says an ownership change at the complex led to confusion over billing which led to a constable showing up at her door earlier this month with a 24-hour notice to vacate.</p>



<p>“It was devastating,” Hardaway said. “I was shocked because I never received any paperwork.”</p>



<p>The paperwork Hardaway is referring to is a notice provided by a court to appear if you want to challenge your eviction.</p>



<p>She says that notice never arrived.</p>



<p>Mark Melton is an attorney at the <a href="https://www.dallaseac.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dallaseac.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dallas Eviction Advocacy Center</a> which provides free legal assistance for families facing eviction.</p>



<p>He says this case is unlike any of thousands he’s seen before.</p>



<p>“We have a situation where we have a tenant that never got her day in court through no fault of her own,” Melton said.</p>



<p>Melton says notices for an eviction hearing are typically sent on computer-generated timed stamped documents. Melton says the notice produced by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://judgemo.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://judgemo.org/" target="_blank">Dallas County Justice of the Peace, Precinct 2, Place 1</a> was in the form of a letter with the court’s letterhead at the top.</p>



<p>“This thing looked very odd,” Melton said.</p>



<p>He adds at least one member of the court staff has conveyed that no notice was ever provided to Chantal Hardaway and the letter was created and placed into her court file only after Melton asked for it to be produced earlier this month.</p>



<p>It is an allegation the judge who handled the eviction case strongly denies.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dallascounty.org/government/jpcourts/2-1/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.dallascounty.org/government/jpcourts/2-1/" target="_blank">Judge Margaret O’Brien</a> told NBC 5 she has no reason to believe any record was falsified.</p>



<p>“A comment by one clerk, if made, that they did not recall a particular document when they previously flipped through the pages of a file does not mean the document was not in the file. Nor does it validate any accusation of fraud.”</p>



<p>Now a higher court in Dallas County has stepped in. A judge issued a temporary restraining order this week halting any eviction until a hearing August 25 to figure out if the claim of document forgery is valid.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Luis Arraez and Jose Miranda hit back-to-back home runs in the first inning, and that was enough for Dylan Bundy as the Minnesota Twins beat the Texas Rangers 2-1 on Friday night.</p>



<p>Bundy (7-5) gave up a run on just two hits in 5 1/3 innings. Minnesota won its fourth game in a row and kept pace with Cleveland, which leads the Twins by one game in the American League Central. Jorge Lopez walked a pair of batters but closed out his third save with the Twins and 22nd overall.</p>



<p>Arraez, the AL batting leader, opened the scoring with his seventh homer of the year. He had six homers in 245 major league games coming into the season. Miranda, the rookie who was the team&#8217;s minor league player of the year last season, followed with his 12th homer.</p>



<p>Martin Perez (9-4) surrendered two runs on five hits and three walks in six innings. The former Twins left-hander had seven strikeouts. He&#8217;s allowed more than three runs just four times in 24 starts this season, including a six-run outing against Minnesota on July 9.</p>



<p>Adolis Garcia led off the second with a single to extend his hitting streak to 16 games, the longest active streak in the majors and the longest for Texas since Elvis Andrus hit safely in 19 straight in 2018.</p>



<p>The Rangers have lost three of four and 13 of 17 since the All-Star break.</p>



<p>Garcia&#8217;s single was the only hit against Bundy through the fifth. Rookie Bubba Thompson singled to start the sixth and stole second base. Thompson scored on Nathaniel Lowe&#8217;s single off reliever Caleb Thielbar.</p>



<p>It was the first run allowed by the Twins after 31 straight scoreless innings, falling one short of the club record set in 2004.</p>



<p><strong>TRAINER&#8217;S ROOM</strong></p>



<p>Rangers: RHP Joe Barlow was placed on the 15-day injured list with another recurrence of a blister on his right index finger. Barlow, who has been Texas&#8217; closer for much of the season, has 13 saves and a 3.16 ERA this season. RHP A.J. Alexy was recalled from Triple-A Round Rock.</p>



<p>Twins: RHP Tyler Mahle (shoulder fatigue) will not throw for a few days and he&#8217;s unlikely to start in his next turn in the rotation. The team hasn&#8217;t decided if he will have a stint on the injured list. . 2B Jorge Polanco was back in the lineup after missing three games with knee soreness.</p>



<p><strong>UP NEXT</strong></p>



<p>RHP Chris Archer (2-6, 4.15 ERA) will start for Minnesota on Saturday evening in the second game of the four-game series. Texas will counter with RHP Glenn Otto (5-8, 4.96). Archer gave up three runs in four innings in his last start. Otto has allowed two runs or less in his last three starts.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Just a few days out from celebrating the first anniversary of Rye&#8217;s second location, the team behind the restaurant is mourning the loss of the first.</p>



<p>“A day I would’ve never remembered has become a day I will never forget. The call is just, ‘The restaurant is on fire. You need to come now,&#8217;” said owner Tanner Agar.</p>



<p>Monday morning, Agar rushed to downtown McKinney as firefighters battled flames in an alley courtyard that left part of Rye&#8217;s kitchen destroyed and, in a sense, Agar and his partners&#8217; dream.</p>



<p>“The three of us, we&#8217;re 25 years old, we start this restaurant, 13 tables, 165-year-old historic building and we just started a restaurant to cook what we believed in,” he said.</p>



<p>That was four years ago. Since then, they&#8217;ve developed a loyal following, regulars with reservations now on pause for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>While managing two other businesses, Agar and his team are turning their focus to starting over.</p>



<p>“It’s just become this absolute, all out, everybody, all hands on deck, what are we doing,” said Agar.</p>



<p>For now, Agar said he has more questions than answers.</p>



<p>Though his team has been cleared of liability, they still don’t know a cause for the fire.</p>



<p>Rye was closed at the time it began.</p>



<p>Still, as they move forward, Agar said he feels buoyed by support he never imagined would travel all the way to his location on lower Greenville.</p>



<p>“I’m looking over my reservations for the next three days, and it&#8217;s so many names that I know are making the drive down here to be supportive of our work,” he said.</p>



<p>Agar said it could be six months before the McKinney restaurant is back up and running.</p>



<p>“I promise the version of Rye that comes back is going to be bigger. It&#8217;s going to be better,” said Agar.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Plano police are investigating one of the most high-tech peeping tom cases ever in the city.</p>



<p>Edward Henderson, 53, has been charged with improper visual recording and criminal trespass.</p>



<p>So far, police say they&#8217;ve identified four victims But that they&#8217;re still sifting through more than a decade worth of recordings.</p>



<p>It began at a home on Harpers Place in Plano when a 14-year-old girl saw a man by her bedroom window on April 28.</p>



<p>The teen told her dad but the man got away.</p>



<p>But when the teen saw the man again by her window four days later on May 2, her dad was ready.</p>



<p>“Followed him and got a license plate number and that&#8217;s when he filed a report and we started doing the investigation,” said Jerry Minton, acting public information officer for the Plano Police Department.</p>



<p>Police say they discovered two small cameras on windowsills of the teen&#8217;s bedroom and bathroom, and a Wi-Fi device by a backyard fence.</p>



<p>“The cameras were communicating with the Wi-Fi hotspot which was transmitting whatever the cameras were seeing to whoever&#8217;s receiving them at the time,” said Minton.</p>



<p>That person, detectives say, was Henderson, a music teacher at a local private school who also leads drum circles for a business called &#8220;Experience the Drum.”</p>



<p>Police say the plate number seen by the 14-year-old&#8217;s father led to Henderson and a trove of more evidence.</p>



<p>“Then they also started finding more and more images from other people, other residences as well, with cameras being placed on or near the windows looking in,” said Minton.</p>



<p>According to an arrest affidavit, &#8220;several computer hard drives and memory cards&#8221; of Henderson&#8217;s were seized from the private school where he worked.</p>



<p>In them were &#8220;numerous videos and photos,&#8221; including more than a dozen taken of the 14-year-old&#8217;s bedroom.</p>



<p>“Where someone would expect to have the utmost privacy,” said Minton.</p>



<p>So far, police have identified two more adult female victims &#8220;recorded while they showered, used the bathroom and changed clothes,” according to an arrest affidavit.</p>



<p>A fourth victim was located in Murphy.</p>



<p>“They were able to go back between 10 and 20 years of recordings,” said Minton.</p>



<p>Police say this goes above and beyond what people think of as a typical peeping tom case.</p>



<p>“This guy was using technology against the victims and residence and then viewing everything remotely to where he’s not actually physically at the location other than setting up and retrieving his property,” said Minton.</p>



<p>Henderson remains in the Collin County jail.</p>



<p>He does not have an attorney listed and we were unable to reach anyone on his behalf.</p>



<p>Police say they are looking for more victims.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Students have headed back to school in North Texas with the usual mix of excitement and nervousness.  </p>



<p>Perhaps it was felt a bit more here at Kipp Oak Cliff Academy, the high school opened its doors this week on a college campus.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awesome, you&#8217;re in a new environment, you feel comfortable, safer, happier. I&#8217;m happy in the building,&#8221; said Valeria Reyes, a student.</p>



<p>Oak Cliff Academy is now inside one of the buildings that wasn&#8217;t being used at Paul Quinn College.</p>



<p>Now high schoolers aren&#8217;t just taking college classes in high school but taking them on a college campus and the college gets a pipeline of brand new students.</p>



<p>Administrators at the school say they&#8217;re already seeing the synergy.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m actually going to know that student. &#8216;Oh we&#8217;re cool, he helped me with math,&#8217; and so now we have that direct lifeline which we know specifically for students of color that access piece and feeling like they have advocacy and a connection point in colleges is really the difference between staying on and finishing or leaving early,&#8221; said Wauneta Van, Principal, KIPP Oak Cliff Academy.</p>



<p>You may have heard that Paul Quinn College also partnered with Dallas ISD to create a middle school on campus.  </p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve created a pathway for everyone in that family to improve their stature of life,&#8221; said Michael Sorrells, President, Paul Quinn College.</p>



<p>Dallas ISD hopes to add a high school here as well, it&#8217;s all part of the master plan to better connect this historically black college to its community, and help students know what it can offer them in life whether it&#8217;s at this school or another.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>There&#8217;s a reason <a href="https://www.donartemio.us/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.donartemio.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don Artemio Mexican Heritage</a> on 7th Street in Fort Worth doesn&#8217;t have the word &#8216;restaurant&#8217; in its name. </p>



<p>&#8220;We wanted to bring not just the cuisine of northeast Mexico and other parts of Mexico, but the elements,&#8221; General Manager Adrián Burciaga said. &#8220;So we just wanted to share the true and original Mexican cultural heritage with the community.&#8221;</p>



<p>That cultural heritage is in every detail. Burciaga and his business partner, Chef Juan Ramón Cárdenas Cantú, are from Saltillo, Mexico. Their home is in every detail.</p>



<p>&#8220;Saltillo is known for clay,&#8221; Burciaga said, pointing out the 250 planters in front of the restaurant and 20,287 bricks inside were all handmade by artisans in Saltillo. &#8220;But different designs, different textures.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saltillo is also known for serapes, which are made on a loom. Serapes and looms from Saltillo are used in the light fixtures.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s challenging times. It&#8217;s hard to travel these days,&#8221; Burciaga said. &#8220;So instead of you buying a $500 ticket to visit Saltillo, as you enter the restaurant, create a wow factor.&#8221;</p>



<p>Part of that includes a book collection with works authored by the restaurant&#8217;s namesake, Don Artemio.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go dine out.&#8217; It&#8217;s, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go have an experience,'&#8221; Burciaga said. &#8220;We want people to connect.&#8221;</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>A North Texas mother grieving the loss of her teenage daughter is asking the public’s help in finding her late daughter’s puppy that has been missing for several days.</p>



<p>Penny the pug is not just a family pet for Summer Herrera.</p>



<p>“Penny was my daughter Zofia’s pug,” she said through tears. “Penny is the last present that Zofia got from us.”</p>



<p>Tragically, 13-year-old Zofia died suddenly after suffering a cerebral aneurism on New Year&#8217;s Eve while visiting her father in Florida.</p>



<p>“Penny’s the last thing that we have of Zofia,” she said.</p>



<p>Herrera said shortly before her daughter died she was busy collecting clothes for her new puppy to wear. But Zofia didn’t just collect clothes for Penny, for years the girl had also worked to collect clothes for homeless people in the community.</p>



<p>“Zofia started collecting jackets for people that were homeless when she was five,” said Herrera.</p>



<p>After she died, Zofia’s friends and teachers in Crowley continued to collect jackets for the homeless in her honor, calling the effort, ‘Warmed by Zie.’</p>

<p>“They collected so many jackets that we had to have a U-Haul truck come in and get them to take them to where they were needed,” said Herrera.</p>



<p>This grieving family now hopes someone will help them in their time of need.</p>



<p>Mom said 9-month-old Penny appears to have dug a hole under their fence at their Crowley home and taken off. She was last seen Tuesday near the town&#8217;s Walmart. She is fawn in color and is not microchipped.</p>



<p>The Herrera’s have checked area shelters and followed up on tips but have had no luck tracking down the puppy.</p>



<p>“If you see Penny or any pug, let us know,” pleaded Herrera. “We’ve been helping other people this week find their dogs.”</p>



<p>She hopes someone has the dog and will return her, even offering to buy the person another pug if they cannot afford one.</p>



<p>If you have any information about Penny’s whereabouts, please contact Summer Herrera at <a href="mailto:summer.z.herrera@gmail.com">summer.z.herrera@gmail.com</a>. </p>

<p>An innovative procedure may offer a sure-fire way to give relief to people who suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>



<p>Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that causes numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hand and it happens because of pressure on your median nerve.</p>



<p>The nerve runs the length of your arm, goes through a passage in your wrist called the carpal tunnel and ends in your hand.</p>



<p>Anything that squeezes or irritates the median nerve in the carpal tunnel space may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>



<p>Many times, there is no single cause of carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>



<p>Patrice Johnson, of Grand Prairie, suffered for years until she underwent the most aggressive treatment for the condition, which was a surgical operation called carpal tunnel release.</p>



<p>&#8220;However, it took so long for me to heal with my right hand that I was like, &#8216;Oh, I don&#8217;t have any more time off work for my left hand,&#8221; said Johnson.</p>



<p>Luckily, by the time she was ready to do the operation on her left hand, a new option became available.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.methodisthealthsystem.org/doctors/shaun-p-garff-do/?utm_source=shineonline&amp;utm_medium=blogpost&amp;utm_campaign=technology">Dr. Shaun Garff, sports medicine specialist on the medical staff at Methodist Mansfield Medical Center</a>, is one of a handful of North Texas doctors offering an in-office, minimally invasive nonsurgical technique with ultrasound technology.</p>



<p>Through a small incision, the doctor uses ultrasound to guide instruments to the ligament carpal ligament that’s trapping the nerve.</p>



<p>Once there, doctors sever the ligament, relieving pressure inside the wrist.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the same procedure that&#8217;s normally in the operating room, but thanks to ultrasound technology, it can be done without the use of anesthesia and results in little downtime.</p>



<p>&#8220;The recovery is phenomenal and very quick, and they&#8217;re getting relief very, very quickly as well,&#8221; said Garff.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, I was making jokes because I&#8217;ve never been awake in a surgery. It&#8217;s amazing,&#8221; said Johnson, now no longer crippled by the common painful condition.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel like the old me.&#8221;</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Inside iVibe Salon in Red Oak owner CeCe Sillemon-Williams made sure it honors her sister Shelbi Stephens.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have put her in every part of the salon and I mean because when you see pink, pink is always for her,” Shelbi Stephen’s sister CeCe Sillemon-William said. “From the pink chairs to the pink wall to even the silhouette in the B is hers.&#8221;</p>



<p>They would have worked side by side in the salon but Stephens’ life <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/young-mother-identified-as-victim-in-wrong-way-crash/252338/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was cut short in 2019.</a>  A wrong-way driver on the Dallas North Tollway crashed into the car she was in with several friends. Stephens did not survive.</p>



<p>Also gone, is the dream her father says she had since she was a little girl of becoming a stylist.</p>



<p>&#8220;I remember getting her a Barbie doll head that she first started creating with,&#8221; her father Wayne Stephens said.</p>



<p>Despite her death, her dream became a reality Friday. The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation granted her an honorary license.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="4032" height="3024" src="https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS-6.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all&#038;strip=all&#038;resize=4032%2C3024" alt="" class="wp-image-7342099" srcset="https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS-6.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=4032&amp;strip=all 4032w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS-6.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300&amp;strip=all 300w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS-6.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768&amp;strip=all 768w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS-6.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1536&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS-6.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=2048&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS-6.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=800&amp;strip=all 800w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS-6.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=400&amp;strip=all 400w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS-6.jpg?w=3000&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>&#8220;Even though she was taken from me early, or taken from us early, God had a purpose and that purpose was for her to complete life and that&#8217;s what she did,&#8221; Wayne Stephens said.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was important to us and the family because she had sacrificed and worked very hard to get through cosmetology school and supporting her son,&#8221; Sillemon-Williams said.</p>



<p>This moment means Stephens can still inspire her little brother and others with her accomplishment.</p>



<p>&#8220;She still kept pushing forward even through tough times she still continued to push for to achieve her main goal,&#8221; her brother Carrington Stephens said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="4032" height="3024" src="https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS1-2.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all&#038;strip=all&#038;resize=4032%2C3024" alt="" class="wp-image-7342101" srcset="https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS1-2.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=4032&amp;strip=all 4032w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS1-2.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300&amp;strip=all 300w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS1-2.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768&amp;strip=all 768w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS1-2.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1536&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS1-2.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=2048&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS1-2.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=800&amp;strip=all 800w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS1-2.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=400&amp;strip=all 400w, https://media.nbcdfw.com/2022/08/Image-from-iOS1-2.jpg?w=3000&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Family and friends released balloons in Stephens’ favorite color to honor her achievement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today brings a lot of joy,&#8221; Wayne Stephens said.</p>



<p>And to let go of a bit of sadness.</p>



<p>&#8220;It brings closure,&#8221; Sillemon-Williams said.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>A Colleyville woman pleaded guilty Thursday for her role in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol and will be sentenced later this year.</p>



<p>Katherine Schwab said she accepted an offer to fly on a Facebook friend&#8217;s private jet and admitted to writing in messages before the Capitol attack that &#8220;s&#8211;t will go down&#8221; and that she needed to &#8220;stop the steal.&#8221;</p>



<p>Schwab traveled to Washington, D.C., with codefendants <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/tag/jenna-ryan/">Jenna Ryan</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/this-will-be-historic-third-north-texas-realtor-facing-charges-in-u-s-capitol-riot/2542485/">Jason Lee Hyland</a>, and admitted she was the first of the trio to enter the Capitol on Jan. 6.</p>



<p>“I went into the f&#8212;ing Capitol,&#8221; Schwab admitted saying in a video recording on the day of the riot, calling police “traitors,” “sheep” and “pathetic.&#8221;</p>



<p>“You want a revolution, the revolution’s gonna come… you want a f&#8212;ing revolution, it’ll happen,&#8221; Schwab also admitted saying.</p>



<p>Schwab also said she kicked and threw media equipment with other members of the mob outside the capitol.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>A basketball tournament will be held in Duncanville this weekend in honor of a Dallas ISD star student-athlete who was killed in a car crash.</p>



<p>Deshawn Jagwan, 18, was a senior at Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/dallas-isd-star-athlete-student-leader-remembered-following-fatal-crash/2941258/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/dallas-isd-star-athlete-student-leader-remembered-following-fatal-crash/2941258/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the time of his death in April</a>. Jagwan’s family accepted his diploma weeks later, as he graduated with honors.</p>



<p>“I have to trust that God had a plan for him and believe that. My family, we all do,” his mother Charlotte Stephens said.</p>



<p>Stephens said her son was a talented basketball player and had dreams of playing professionally. He received an offer to play on the collegiate level and received an offer for a full scholarship from Park University Gilbert in Arizona shortly after his death.</p>



<p>This weekend, a tournament will be held at the Duncanville Field House with proceeds benefiting graduating high school seniors.</p>



<p>Stephens said many of the players who are signed up to participate this weekend played basketball with her son over the years.</p>



<p>“He had dreams of playing in college and certainly, the next level, NBA. Just so many high hopes and aspirations that weren’t fulfilled. We’re just going to keep the movement going for him,” she said. “One of the things he wrote in his farewell to Woodrow Wilson was to keep moving. He wanted the players to believe in themselves.”</p>



<p>Stephens said initially, she expected about 10 teams to sign up. As it would turn out, more teams expressed interest in showing their support and she said the deadline to register was extended twice. There are now dozens signed up this weekend, she said.</p>



<p>“It’s just a testament to who Deshawn was. He was the compassionate, sensitive, caring friend, brother you could have had,” she said. “At his services, we figured we would have only 100 or 200 people there. I’m told it was way over 1,100 people there. I think that’s a testament to who he was at such a young age.”</p>



<p>Shortly after Deshawn’s passing, the family launched the <a href="https://www.duncanvillefieldhouse.com/sponsor/deshawn-jagwan-athletic-foundation/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.duncanvillefieldhouse.com/sponsor/deshawn-jagwan-athletic-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deshawn Jagwan Athletic Foundation</a>. The foundation has been able to provide student-athletes with scholarship money.</p>



<p>The tournament begins at 10 a.m. Saturday, Aug. 20.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Justin Herbert and Dak Prescott will be on the sidelines when the Los Angeles Chargers host the Dallas Cowboys in a preseason game on Saturday night. Both quarterbacks got plenty of snaps, though, the past two days during joint practices.</p>



<p>Herbert and Prescott practiced on adjacent fields at the Jack Hammett Sports Complex, but both took part in a friendly round of target practice after the two-hour session ended.</p>



<p>“I think they ended up winning, but it was fun to just see those guys and hang out with them a little bit,” Herbert said of the side competition between the two QB groups. “I’ve only met him a couple of times, but I really respect him as a player and as a competitor, as well.”</p>



<p>Dallas coach Mike McCarthy said early in camp that Prescott could play in the preseason finale on Aug. 26 against Seattle. Chargers coach Brandon Staley, though, does not play the majority of his starters in any of the three preseason games.</p>



<p>For Herbert, the joint practices were the closest thing to a dress rehearsal that he is going to get before the Chargers’ regular-season opener against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sept. 11.</p>



<p>“It means everything to us. Since we’re not playing in the preseason we need to take advantage of these reps, and we did,” Herbert said. “We felt like we really got after it the past couple of days. To go up against a team like that, I think it’s a great learning lesson for us as well, to see a team that flies around like that and a front seven like they have.”</p>



<p>Herbert had a nice completion to Keenan Allen in the back of the end zone but also threw an interception on the first play of a two-minute drill.</p>

<p>Herbert said having to adjust on the fly against another defense as well as seeing how the offensive line held up in pass protection was a bonus.</p>



<p>“That’s a good front line that they have up there. To see those guys fly around up close and personal, I think it’s a great job for us to be able to learn and grow from that and continue to compete against those guys. So, it’s been good for us,” Herbert said.</p>



<p>Prescott did have the highlight play to end Thursday’s practice with a Hail Mary to Dennis Houston, who got position over teammate Simi Fehoko and Chargers cornerback Asante Samuel Jr. to come up with the ball.</p>



<p>“It was definitely good to end on that note, and just being in that situation, end of the game, having to go Hail Mary with the clock running,” Prescott said. “The guys did a good job of protecting, giving me a lane, letting me buy some time.”</p>



<p>CeeDee Lamb missed both days of practice due to a foot injury, dealing another blow to a diminished Cowboys’ wide receiver group already missing Michael Gallup (ACL) and James Washington (foot). Prescott’s day featured a lot of handoffs to running backs Ezekiel Elliott and Tony Pollard along with short passes.</p>



<p>While Lamb is expected to return to practice next week, Gallup and Washington are expected to be sidelined when the Cowboys open the season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>



<p>Prescott said he isn’t getting frustrated over having an inexperienced wide receiver group, but he is hoping to see them make strides the next two weeks.</p>



<p>“This is exactly about that time to work and make other guys step up, take advantage of their opportunity,” he said. “Those guys got to know what I expect from them and how they expect me to throw the ball, so that’s all good things to be worked on.”</p>



<p>Chargers coach Brandon Staley was also pleased with the two practices and noted that the snaps provided more quality for the first units compared to a preseason game because different situations could be practiced.</p>



<p>“You get more plays, and then the types of schemes that you’re playing against you’re seeing their premium scheme, where in the preseason no one is running their premium scheme,” he said. “These practices are where it’s at. They may not get into the red zone in a preseason game, you may not have a two-minute situation that kind of expresses itself, so you’re able to control what happens.”</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Tarrant County cities are on the verge of entering &#8220;state one&#8221; of the emergency drought plan which would bring additional water restrictions to residents and businesses.</p>



<p>Fort Worth is already limiting outdoor watering to just twice a week with no watering allowed on Mondays or any day between the hours of 10 a.m. and 6 p.m.</p>



<p>Smart water meters installed by the city of Fort Worth collect and send data about water usage and officials said they&#8217;ve noticed a high number of people not following the rules.</p>



<p>Because of low lake levels, city officials said they&#8217;ll be keeping a close eye on next week&#8217;s rainfall and that even a few cloudy days could help reduce water consumption.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to realize that the loss to surface water to lakes is not only from use, but It&#8217;s also from evaporation. So, if you have rainfall you have clouds. So, you&#8217;re reducing evaporation. Even if no rain falls, the clouds will reduce the evaporative loss in the lakes,&#8221; said Mary Gugliuzza, with the Fort Worth Water Department.</p>



<p>Cloud cover even makes people use less water in their grass or in their pools, bringing down water usage as a whole.</p>

<p>Does it feel like you blinked and summer is just about over? Blame it on high gas prices, chaos with the airlines, or expensive hotel rooms … but a lot of us didn’t get that “summer vacation” we dreamed about.</p>



<p>But before the longer days slip away, Consumer Reports says it’s not too late to make some lasting summer memories, for free.</p>



<p>Whether during the week or a weekend once school starts, there are things you can do in and out of the house to keep little ones entertained &#8211; often for free.</p>



<p>For example, going to a museum. If you receive SNAP benefits, you can get free or reduced admission to over 900 museums through a program called Museums for All. And if you have a library card, many libraries offer free passes to museums in your city.</p>



<p>How about taking the kids to a live event? Through sites like Eventbrite and Allevents.in, you can find free concerts or classes, like a kid&#8217;s break dance class.</p>



<p>Or maybe you’d like to instill a sense of community in your kids and teach them how to give back? You can find local volunteer opportunities that the family can do together through VolunteerMatch.org.</p>



<p>Rainy days can be a great time to stay in and watch some movies as a family. With sites like Kanopy and Hoopla, you can access loads of movies and TV shows for free with just your library card. You can access both on multiple streaming devices, and buying a device doesn’t have to break the bank. The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max is a good value at $55.</p>



<p>The end of summer can get pretty hot, so if you do end up spending time outside with the family, always practice sun and heat safety &#8211; wear sunscreen and drink plenty of water.</p>



<p>With these tips, keeping the little ones occupied for the rest of the summer may get a bit easier.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Bijan Robinson and his Lamborghini sum up what most believe Texas football should be: flashy, fun to watch and faster than anybody else out there.</p>



<p>Far too often, however, the Longhorns find a way to run themselves into a ditch.</p>



<p>Texas starts the season unranked after a 5-7 finish in 2021 with no bowl game and the longest losing streak since 1956 in coach Steve Sarkisian’s debut. Years of legacy votes that presumed Texas was deserving of preseason rankings have finally vanished after too many seasons of unmet expectations.</p>



<p>And yet, there is optimism in Austin. At least the kind that assumes last season was so bad, this one has to be better.</p>



<p>For starters, there is talent on campus in the form of some of college football’s best playmakers. The fluid and powerful Robinson (in and out of that Lamborghini courtesy of a name, image and likeness sponsorship deal) is one of the top backs in the country. Wide receiver Xavier Worthy had an explosive freshman season in 2021 and should be among the favorites for the Biletnikoff Award.</p>



<p>The rest is anyone’s guess.</p>



<p>Sarkisian mined the transfer portal about as well as anybody and even landed a starting quarterback in freshman Quinn Ewers, of Southlake, who beat out Hudson Card for the job. But that road has been bumpy with one transfer receiver (Isaiah Neyor from Wyoming) lost for the season to a knee injury and another (Agiye Hall from Alabama) suspended indefinitely.</p>



<p>And an offensive line already strapped for depth also lost starter Junior Angilou, who could play multiple positions, for the season to a knee injury.</p>



<p>Texas hasn’t won the Big 12 since 2009 and most pick the Longhorns for the middle of the pack again. Still, that would be a step up from last year.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">QUARTERBACK</h2>



<p>Ewers is a huge arm talent, he just lacks college experience. He was the quarterback everyone wanted out of high school near Dallas and Ohio State signed him. But a freshman season of sitting around Columbus prompted a transfer. That put him in a fight for the job with Card, who started the first two games in 2021 before getting benched. Sarkisian had a quick hook on his QB last year with struggles, so is Card still in play or would he consider a transfer?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">SECOND HALF FOLLIES</h2>



<p>The Longhorns lost five games last season they led at halftime. Texas has to shake off a bad combination of second-half adjustments and suspect conditioning if they don’t want to get dominated in the third and fourth quarters again. Hiring former TCU head coach and defensive guru Gary Patterson as a special assistant may prove to be Sarkisian’s shrewdest move of the offseason.</p>



<p>’Having Coach Patterson on board has probably been something that has excited me the most out of a lot of things we’ve done this off-season,” Sarkisian said. “I’ve always admired his defensive mind.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">ROBINSON &amp; CO.</h2>



<p>Sarkisian will lean heavily on his dependable run game while he sorts things out at quarterback. Robinson is the star after rushing for 1,127 yards and 11 touchdowns in a season cut short by a dislocated elbow. Behind him are workhorse Roschon Johnson and speedy Keilan Robinson.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">HOT SEAT</h2>



<p>Sarkisian may have felt some heat from Texas fans during that dismal debut season, but not so much from the administration and Board of Regents that approved his original six-year, $34.2 million guaranteed contract. But Texas likely won’t abide another years-long skid like it endured under Charlie Strong from 2014-2016.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">LOOKING AHEAD</h2>



<p>A blockbuster matchup with No. 1 Alabama on Sept. 10 will determine if Texas is ready for prime time. Then comes a matchup with rising UTSA, where coach Jeff Traylor, a former Longhorns assistant, could snag a huge statement win. The Big 12 schedule starts Sept. 24 at Texas Tech and the annual Red River Rivalry game with Oklahoma is Oct. 8 in Dallas.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Baylor settled on its top quarterback in the spring, giving sophomore Blake Shapen time to adjust to his new role and letting the 10th-ranked Bears prepare for this season knowing their starter.</p>



<p>“I’m not the backup quarterback anymore, so I’ve got to take full control of everything that’s going on on the field,” Shapen said. “I think I learned a lot of things being the backup. Stepping up into a leadership role is key for me right now.”</p>



<p>The quarterback competition last year went into fall camp before Gerry Bohanon was named the starter over Shapen and Jacob Zeno (now at UAB) only two weeks before the first game. Shapen beat out the incumbent junior in spring practice this time.</p>



<p>“He’s a slinger,” said junior receiver Gavin Holmes, who is back after missing last season with a knee injury. “Blake’s a stud. He’s got an arm, accurate quarterback, but we put in the work together to get that timing right.”</p>



<p>Shapen was 62-of-86 passing (72.1%) for 596 yards with five touchdowns and no interceptions in limited action last season, but that included being the Big 12 championship game MVP in one of his two starts when Bohanon had a late-season hamstring injury. Bohanon was back for the Sugar Bowl victory that capped Baylor’s record 12-win season after Shapen hurt his shoulder.</p>



<p>Coach Dave Aranda said it was apparent in the spring that Shapen was the better passer and should be the starter. But it was still difficult personally for the coach who has photos at home of his kids posing with Bohanon.</p>



<p>“There is no me without Gerry, there is no last year without Gerry,” Aranda said. “Wanting the best for him, I think it was the fair thing to do, was to make that move early.”</p>



<p>That gave Bohanon just enough time to get into the transfer portal. He went to South Florida, and is now the No. 1 QB for the Bulls.</p>



<p>“I have a lot of respect for (Aranda), and him doing that for me and Gerry,” Shapen said. “That means a lot to both of us. … The opportunity to move on and do what we need to do in the future.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">NO MORE SURPRISES</h2>



<p>Plenty of people were surprised by Baylor’s 10-win improvement and Big 12 title, which came a year after Aranda’s 2-7 debut in the pandemic-altered 2020 season. Not the players.</p>



<p>“Once you’ve put in that work, you put in the work all summer … you know what you have, you know the foundation you set,” fifth-year cornerback Mark Milton said.</p>



<p>There will no sneaking up on anyone this year. Along with their top-10 ranking, the Bears are the preseason Big 12 favorite for the first time.</p>



<p>“Coach has reiterated that we’re going to have a target on our back,” Holmes said. “We’ve got to go out there with something to prove still.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">UP FRONT</h2>



<p>The Bears are solid up front with plenty of experience on both sides of the line.</p>



<p>All-Big 12 left tackle Connor Galvin, a fifth-year senior who has started 36 games at Baylor, was tabbed as the Big 12’s top offensive lineman last year. There are also three sixth-year seniors, Grant Miller and a pair of graduate transfers going into their second season starting for the Bears, Jacob Gall (Buffalo) and Grant Miller (Vanderbilt).</p>



<p>“Everybody knows the words we’re saying, everybody knows the terms, everybody knows what the expectations are,” Galvin said. “It’s nice, you’re not having to really reinforce those.”</p>



<p>The defensive front is anchored by 6-foot-4, 358-pound All-Big 12 defensive tackle Siaki Ika. Baylor also added hometown transfer Jaxon Player, a senior from Waco who had nine sacks and 23 ½ tackles for loss over the past two seasons at Tulsa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">DRAFTED DEFENDERS</h2>



<p>Big 12 defensive player of the year Jalen Pitre, who played a hybrid linebacker-defensive back position, and All-Big 12 linebacker Terrel Bernard were both NFL draft picks. Middle linebacker Dillon Doyle, a fifth-year senior with 23 consecutive starts, is the top returning tackle with 90 last season. Matt Jones and Garmon Randolph have also started games at linebacker.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">THE GAMES</h2>



<p>Baylor opens the season at home against FCS team Albany, then has a loaded road schedule. The Bears play at future Big 12 team No. 25 BYU in Week 2, and have five of their nine conference games away from home. That includes November games at No. 9 Oklahoma and Texas.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>TCU senior linebacker Dee Winters and his teammates certainly weren’t used to the sometimes carnival-like atmosphere during spring practice with fans around the field watching their every move.</p>



<p>“It was pretty abnormal,” Winters said. “Three years without it, so it was kind of different.”</p>



<p>New Horned Frogs coach Sonny Dykes got an inside look at the program while working in an off-field role for Gary Patterson in 2017. All of Patterson’s practices were pretty much limited to essential personnel only.</p>



<p>Dykes has opened things up.</p>



<p>“I got over here in ’17 and I was just like, `Wow, this is a great place, Fort Worth’s a great town. All the stuff is here that you need to be able to build a great football program.’ And obviously, coach Patterson had done that,” Dykes said. “It was a little bit of eye-opener for me, just having been over here and then, kind of the circumstances worked the way that they did, and here I now. It’s been an interesting journey.”</p>



<p>Dykes went 30-18 the past four seasons at SMU, the most successful stretch for the Mustangs in three decades since being the only program shut down by the NCAA’s so-called death penalty.</p>



<p>Patterson’s school-record 181 wins over 21 seasons include the Rose Bowl in an undefeated 2010 season. But the Frogs are 23-24 since making the Big 12 championship game in 2017. They split their final four games after Patterson and the school mutually agreed on Oct. 31 to immediately part ways and finished 5-7.</p>



<p>“TCU is about winning championships,” Dykes said. “I want to coach in this kind of environment where there has been that level of success and there’s that level of expectations as well.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">QB COMPETITION</h2>



<p>Max Duggan and Chandler Morris went into fall camp competing to be the starting quarterback. Duggan started 29 games the past three seasons, and Morris started twice last year while Duggan was dealing with a fractured bone in his foot.</p>



<p>“You’re not going to have a season without some adversity,” said Duggan, adding his frustration was more about another losing season for TCU than his injury.</p>



<p>Morris threw for 461 yards and two touchdowns in his first start against Baylor. His 531 total yards were the second-most in school history, but he got hurt in the next game.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">1 VS 1</h2>



<p>Two of the fastest and most skilled players on TCU’s team wear the same number and go against each other in practice.</p>



<p>No. 1 on offense is junior receiver Quentin Johnston. Senior cornerback Tre’Vius Hodges-Tomlinson is No. 1 on the defensive side.</p>



<p>“Kind of leaving the friendship at the door, and between them two lines kind of just battle out to the end,” said Johnston, who averaged 19.9 yards per catch last season and scored six TDs. “At the end of day, it helps both of us, it makes both of us better.”</p>



<p>Tomlinson is the nephew of NFL Hall of Fame running back and former TCU standout LaDainian Tomlinson, but the All-Big 12 defensive back is making a name for himself.</p>



<p>“I’ve always known what I was going to do, growing up with the confidence that I have and the chip that I carry,” Tre’ Tomlinson said. “My uncle, he is outstanding. … Personally, I have to live up to myself first. That’s how I go about it. I think of myself as that great someone too.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">ADDED BACKS</h2>



<p>TCU’s defensive front may look different, but new coordinator Joe Gillespie’s schemes generally use five secondary players like Patterson did.</p>



<p>The Frogs have added two transfer defensive backs who could make an immediate impact, Mark Perry had 72 tackles and three interceptions last season at Colorado, while Josh Newton had 48 tackles and eight pass breakups for Louisiana-Monroe.</p>



<p>Perry’s first game for the Frogs will be on the road against his old team. TCU has a Friday night opener at Colorado on Sept. 2.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">THE SCHEDULE</h2>



<p>TCU closes its non-conference schedule Sept. 24 with Dykes returning to SMU. The 100th Iron Skillet rivalry game last year in Fort Worth had a chaotic postgame scene when some Mustangs players tried to plant their school flag on TCU’s midfield logo. The Big 12 opener is Oct. 1 against ninth-ranked Oklahoma before five conference games on the road, including at No. 10 Baylor and No. 12 Oklahoma State.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[
<p>Joey McGuire describes himself as a high school coach who gets to coach college football. He is, after all, a Texas native who won three state championships under the Friday night lights.</p>



<p>McGuire is now head coach at Texas Tech after his transition to college coaching for the past five years as an assistant at Baylor, one of the state’s other Big 12 schools and the reigning conference champion. He has brought an infectious enthusiasm to an already passionate fan base desperate for a title of its own.</p>



<p>“People have said, ‘How long is that going to take?’ Well, it’s my job to accelerate the process,” McGuire said. “You know, I want it to happen this year, no doubt, and I know the team does too.”</p>



<p>That would be quite a turnaround, considering the Red Raiders haven’t had a winning record in Big 12 play since Mike Leach’s final season on the Lubbock campus in 2009. When Tech was 7-6 last year after a convincing Liberty Bowl victory over Leach-coached Mississippi State, it was the first time in six seasons it finished above .500 overall.<br>Regardless of their record this year, McGuire is already building a solid foundation in his first college head coaching job.</p>



<p>His kinship to Texas high school coaches is having a big impact in recruiting. The school has announced plans for a $200 million project with a new locker room and offices in a new four-story building in the stadium’s south end zone, along with a new, two-story training facility. And the current players have embraced their new coach.</p>



<p>“I believed that (players) would buy into what we were going to do, but I didn’t think it was going to be as fast as it has been,” McGuire said. “It’s just been incredible, the trust that the players have put into us and how hard they’ve been working.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">THE QBS</h2>



<p>Former Oregon transfer Tyler Shough threw for 872 yards and six touchdowns in his four games last season before a broken collarbone. Donovan Smith started the final four games, including the bowl victory, and redshirt freshman Behren Morton is also in the quarterback mix.</p>



<p>McGuire described “a three-horse race” to be the starter, but anticipates using multiple quarterbacks.</p>



<p>“If Donovan Smith doesn’t win the job, I would be crazy not to have a 6-5, 240-pound quarterback not running quarterback power on the goal line,” the coach said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">MORE ON McGUIRE</h2>



<p>Cedar Hill High, in the Dallas area, had never won a playoff game before McGuire’s three championships in 14 seasons. He joined Matt Rhule’s staff at Baylor in 2017, and the Bears were in the Big 12 title game two years later before Rhule left for the NFL.</p>



<p>McGuire stayed with the Bears on coach Dave Aranda’s staff, and they were on way to winning the Big 12 championship when Tech hired him in November to replace the fired Matt Wells. McGuire left immediately to start work in Lubbock while interim coach Sonny Cumbie finished the season on the field.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">BACK AT TECH</h2>



<p>New offensive coordinator Zach Kittley is familiar with Lubbock, and big-scoring offenses.</p>



<p>Kittley was OC last season at Western Kentucky, which averaged 535 yards and 44 points a game, after big numbers at Houston Baptist the previous year. His dad is Tech’s longtime NCAA championship-winning track coach. The younger Kittley worked with Kliff Kingsbury from 2013-17, going from a student assistant to graduate assistant and then assistant QBs coach in a span that included Patrick Mahomes starting for the Red Raiders.</p>



<p>“He’ll say we have Air Raid concepts but we’re not a true Air Raid,” McGuire said of Kittley. “In the interview, he said, ‘Coach, I’m going to find our best 11 players, I’m going to get them on the field, and we’re going to score a lot of points.’”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">THE GAMES</h2>



<p>The season opener on Sept. 3 against Murray State is the first of seven home games for the Red Raiders. Five of those are Big 12 games, including No. 9 Oklahoma, No. 10 Baylor and Texas visiting Lubbock. There are back-to-back non-conference games against Top 25 teams when they host future Big 12 team No. 24 Houston on Sept. 10, then go to No. 13 North Carolina State the next week.</p>

<p>Actor Chuck Norris is promoting a tool that Texas leaders are leaning on to prevent the next school shooting.</p>



<p>With students headed back to class across Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott rolled out <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-dps-launch-iwatchtexas-psa-to-promote-reporting-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a public service campaign for&nbsp;iWatch Texas&nbsp;that featured the&nbsp;<em>Walker, Texas Ranger</em>&nbsp;star</a>.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzMPyL5pYf4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the new PSA</a>, Norris — who starred in the TV series from 1993 to 2001 — said he loves “bringing bad guys to justice.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/texas-news/the-state-pushing-for-expanded-use-of-iwatch-texas-in-schools/3046172/">reporting system allows anyone to anonymously report suspicious activities or behaviors</a> that could indicate criminal, terrorism, or school safety-related threats.</p>



<p>The iWatch system was put in place after&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/?s=santa+fe+school+shooting">shooting at Santa Fe High School</a>&nbsp;outside Houston in 2018.</p>
