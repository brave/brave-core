She hopes to speak enough in five years to pass the citizenship test, which would gain the family European Union passports. With them comes the freedom to move and work throughout much of the continent.</p><p>“You just don’t know where America is headed these days. Are we going to be fighting with each other forever? Are we in the Cold War again with Russia?” Dixon said. “Getting that second passport would be a relief.”</p><p>But resentment of newcomers is growing. Angelenos can’t always escape — and sometimes are at the root of — questions over gentrification, income disparities and immigration. The phrase “expat” itself has become loaded in Lisbon, a city that attracts tens of thousands of working-class immigrants from Brazil, Ukraine, Romania and India. In Facebook groups and cafe meetups, well-to-do Westerners debate over how to define themselves. On the streets, Portuguese activists have protested against evictions and skyrocketing rents caused in part by foreigners with banks that count in dollars and pounds.</p><p>“There’s no doubt that the foreign investment has greatly helped Portugal’s economy and made the cities more beautiful,” said Isabel da Bandeira, an activist who co-founded the Lisbon housing rights group Aqui Mora Gente (People Live Here). “But this process has also hurt the long-term residents who don’t recognize parts of their communities anymore or can’t afford to live in them.”</p><p>Across Lisbon, the country’s largest urban center with 550,000 people, it’s hard to miss the Californians. The city, where tourism has boomed over the years to the point that entire streets in its historic core are made up exclusively of hotels and Airbnbs, has attracted monied newcomers from across the world, including the United Kingdom, Cape Verde, South Africa and Russia. But more Americans are buying expensive property than any other foreigners, surpassing the Chinese.</p><div data-align-center-expanded="" data-click="enhancement"><figure> <picture>         <img

 </picture>   <div> <p>A tram goes up a hill in the historic Alfama neighborhood in Lisbon, Portugal.</p><p>(Jose Sarmento Matos / For The Times)</p> </div>  </figure></div><p>An article last year in the Lisbon-based newspaper Diário de Notícias extolled the ties between California and Portugal. “It’s fundamental to put Portugal on the map for Californians,” Pedro Pinto, the Portuguese consul general in San Francisco, said in the piece, as he suggested a direct flight from Los Angeles to Lisbon “would have high demand” (there’s already one from San Francisco).</p><p>California has long drawn the Portuguese. Spain and Portugal claim 16th century colonial explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who was the first European to land on California’s shores, as one of their own. In the mid-19th century, droves of farmers from the Azores made their way to Central California. In San Jose, the Little Portugal neighborhood pays homage to the region’s immigrant history. But today, the transplants go the other way and are of a different variety: upper middle class or wealthier with online jobs or well-managed retirement accounts.</p><p>After years of divisive politics, failed wars, worsening wealth gaps and fights over national identity, Americans are perhaps more flexible in their patriotism and willing to make a home beyond their borders. For residents of California, where the best and worst of America appear to constantly collide, the shores of Portugal have offered a respite.</p><p>From the retiree villages of Mexico and Central America to the red-white-and-blue enclaves scattered throughout Asia and Europe, Americans have long had a curious and at times contentious relationship with the world and its cultures. They are often viewed as wanting to cast other nations in their image, a criticism cleverly distilled in Graham Greene’s novel “The Quiet American.” They want the exotic so long as there’s a scent of the familiar. </p><p>In Portugal, some recent California expats have taken it upon themselves to make the pitch for how to conjure a bit of their home state while living abroad.</p><p>Jen Wittman, who moved with her husband and 13-year-old son to Lisbon in March last year, runs a Facebook group called Californians Moving To/Living In Portugal. In a community of migrants where dozens of Facebook pages function as a how-to library on moving, Wittman said she created hers a year ago after seeing Californians “getting mocked in other groups for very California questions, like where to get good avocados and Mexican food.”</p><div data-align-center-expanded="" data-click="enhancement"><figure> <picture>         <img

We want the sun, the water, the amenities, the fresh and organic food,” said Wittman, 47, a former chef who runs an online consulting company for small businesses with her husband. “We also tend to have higher incomes than other Americans so people get annoyed when we ask our budgeting questions in other expat groups.”</p><p>A resident of Playa del Rey for 20 years, she left for Lisbon after a stint in Sonoma County.

Even the basic things, such as buying groceries, take longer trips outside the city center than they used to.”</p><p>The trend has hit not “only lifelong, lower-class residents but also gentrifiers who see a 1,000-euros-per-month rented flat transformed into a 120-euro-per-night Airbnb,” said Jordi Mateo, a professor at NOVA University of Lisbon.</p><div data-align-right="" data-click="enhancement"> <div data-module-id="00000180-b599-d00e-a1b0-fdbd5574000c" data-click="infoBox">  <div>    <a aria-label="Postcards from Portugal" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-12/these-californians-relocated-to-portugal-they-share-their-stories"><picture>         <img srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/32b2a79/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1921x606+0+80/resize/320x101!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd6%2F1d%2F213fab624d8b821738670c3ab143%2F220512-portugalexpats-lisbon-stamp-break.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64cb29e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1921x606+0+80/resize/510x161!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd6%2F1d%2F213fab624d8b821738670c3ab143%2F220512-portugalexpats-lisbon-stamp-break.png 510w" alt="postage stamp for Lisbon, Portugal, illustrated with yellow buildings" data-srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/32b2a79/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1921x606+0+80/resize/320x101!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd6%2F1d%2F213fab624d8b821738670c3ab143%2F220512-portugalexpats-lisbon-stamp-break.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64cb29e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1921x606+0+80/resize/510x161!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd6%2F1d%2F213fab624d8b821738670c3ab143%2F220512-portugalexpats-lisbon-stamp-break.png 510w" data-sizes="100vw" width="510" height="161" data-src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64cb29e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1921x606+0+80/resize/510x161!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd6%2F1d%2F213fab624d8b821738670c3ab143%2F220512-portugalexpats-lisbon-stamp-break.png" data-lazy-load="true" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64cb29e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1921x606+0+80/resize/510x161!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd6%2F1d%2F213fab624d8b821738670c3ab143%2F220512-portugalexpats-lisbon-stamp-break.png">  </picture></a>    </div>    <p>Postcards from Portugal</p>   <p>These Californians relocated to Portugal.

As of this year, the nation’s popular “golden visa” program, which offers residency to foreigners who buy homes priced at 500,000 euros or more — Americans dominate the program — is no longer taking applications in the biggest cities. That includes Lisbon, Porto and the Algarve, the southern coastal region long popular with retirees and lovers of surf culture.</p><p>In just a few years, evictions have more than doubled in Lisbon. The city’s former mayor, Fernando Medina, had launched an initiative to rent out hundreds of Airbnbs to use as housing for local workers only to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-airbnb-short-let-reforms-lisbon/">see his ambitions fizzle</a> because owners could make more on the private market. “Lisbon, don’t be French,” said a recent comment on the Facebook page of the activist group Stop Despejos (Stop Evictions), a reference to the exorbitant costs of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-britain-expats-snap-story.html">expat-heavy destinations in France</a>.</p><p>While the nation’s popularity has grown fast during the pandemic with prices for locals and newcomers alike doing the same, those who arrived earlier have in some ways fared better.</p><p>Therese Mascardo, a 39-year-old therapist from Santa Monica, flew to Lisbon in 2019 after experimenting with online sessions to cut down on her four-hour daily round-trip commute to Orange County. Frustrated with the Trump presidency, mass shootings and a car-bound lifestyle, she said she sought out “the antiquity and charm” of an old European city that was walkable. Mascardo was attracted to the fact that right-wing parties have not made the same inroads in the nation as they have elsewhere in Europe.</p><p>Today, she can afford to work just two days a week — on a California schedule — while building out an online social media <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/exploring.therapy/?hl=en">therapy content brand</a> in her free time. She has money to spare after paying her monthly 1,000-euro rent.
