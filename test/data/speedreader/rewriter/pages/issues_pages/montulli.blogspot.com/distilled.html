I get a&nbsp; fair number of questions about cookies from individuals and 
the press.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I would try and explain some of the motivation 
and history behind Web cookies as well as some of the design behind 
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feel free to post more questions and I will try and expand 
this article with more details.

<b>Motivation</b><br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http">HTTP</a> is the 
networking language behind your browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HTTP, or Hyper Text 
Transport Protocol, was designed and introduced as part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Www">WWW</a> 
project that started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cern">CERN</a> and was expanded upon 
by several universities, corporations and private individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
WWW and HTTP are open standards which are published and given into the 
public trust in order to foster interoperability and to create products 
that can become ubiquitous.<br>
<br>
One of the problems faced 
in the early years of the web was how to create websites that had 
"memory" for individual users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The uses of "memory" on a website are 
many: shopping carts for shopping, personalized content, logging in, and
 many other interactive features require memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem in 1994 
was a lack of mechanisms to identify a user individually. &nbsp; HTTP was 
designed to be fast and efficient and part of its design was to connect
 to a website, grab a document and then disconnect. &nbsp; This freed up the 
website to serve other customers, but it also meant that there was no 
concept of a session. &nbsp; &nbsp; Without a session, each time a user clicked to
 move to a different page they would become just another random user 
with no way to associate them with an action they had done just moments 
ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a bit like talking to someone with Alzheimer 
disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each interaction would result in having to introduce yourself again, and again, and again.
<br>
<b>History</b><br>
By the summer 1994 the idea of adding some form of "memory" to HTTP had
 been kicking around the WWW design groups for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure 
exactly how long but I would guess for 1 or 2 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some 
interesting proposals, but one of the popular ones that kept coming up 
was to add a unique identifier to every web browser so that a web site could individually identify 
each user use that to build a session.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was very much against this 
concept because the unique identifier could be used to track a user at 
every website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without another proposal the idea of adding sessions or memory remained dormant.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Sometime around July of 1994 I went to a meeting to talk about a 
shopping server that another group at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape">Netscape</a> was working on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
needed to build shopping cart functionality into the server, but they 
didn't have a good way to make it work with the existing technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
They explained what they wanted to do and I had to shake my head and 
agree with them and tell them that they could not do it in any 
reasonable way with what existed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I promised to think about the 
problem and get back to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point during the next week the 
general concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cookie">Web Cookies</a> formed in my head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea of 
allowing a single web site to send a session identifier to the browser 
that would get sent back only to the server appealed to me and prevented
 cross site tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to create something that had more 
utility so that we could do a lot more than just shopping carts, so I 
extended the concept of the session identifier into a general payload 
that would get sent back to the server.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br>
<b>Design</b><br>
With a rough sketch in my head I worked on the general design of 
cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal was to create a session identifier and general 
"memory" mechanism for websites that didn't allow for cross site 
tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I discussed the design with other members of the 
engineering team and got useful feedback, especially with regard to 
denial of service attracts and other security concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp; John 
Giannandrea was especially helpful with the design.&nbsp;&nbsp; The end result was
 the cookie specification that still defines 95% of what cookies do 
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Web server can return information to the browser that the 
browser should give back to the server each time it contacts the server 
in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the Web Cookie, a server can embed a random 
session identifier, a username, a shopping cart, or anything it wants as
 long as it doesn't try to send something too big or set too many 
cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also restrictions on how cookies can be 
transferred, either over secure connections or not and if the cookie 
should be erased when the user closes the browser or reboots their 
computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>
<b>The name</b><br>
<br>
I had heard the term "magic cookie" from an operating systems course from college.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term has a somewhat similar meaning to the way Web Cookies worked and I liked the term "cookies" for aesthetic reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies was the first thing I came up with and the name stuck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>
<b>Usefulness</b><br>
<br>
We released the Netscape browser in the fall of 1994 and within a 
year it was the most popular browser in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also released 
the Cookie specification so that other browsers could implement it and 
so that web sites would know how to use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With most of the world 
using a browser that supported Web Cookies, web sites started using 
cookies for many different things and in ways that we could not have 
predicted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of those uses were fantastic, some of them were 
concerning.<br>
<br>
By 1996 and 1997 the web had grown dramatically and was a big 
business.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most websites offered their content for free and were 
advertising supported.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advertisers were looking for ways to increase
 the effectiveness of their ads and they looked to Web Cookies to help them with that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>
<b>An Unforeseen Problem</b><br>
A problem that I missed during the Cookie design phase was an 
interaction between cookies and embedded content within a webpage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Webpages start as a single HTML document on one server.&nbsp;&nbsp; That one HTML 
document contains references to other resources that are loaded to 
display the site that the user sees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Images, videos, more text, and 
plug-ins are all references within an HTML document and any of those 
resources can be loaded from anywhere in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This referencing
 technique is one of the things that make the Web so amazingly 
powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Web Cookies are combined with embedded references that point to other websites they are called "3rd party cookies" and they represent a new way in which users can be tracked across multiple web sites.
<br>
<b>Advertising uses</b><br>
Big ad companies, in particular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleclick">DoubleClick</a>, started using 3rd party 
cookies to track a browser uniquely across all of the sites that used 
DoubleClick to serve ads.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the tracking wasn't to 
actually identify the name of a user, but to make sure they didn't see 
the same ad every time or to track the number of unique users that saw a
 particular ad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually the ads were customized to reflect the 
browsing habits of the unique identifiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a browser had looked at
 kayaks and racquetball racquets in the past then they were given ads 
for sporting goods and kayaks and racquets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Around 1996 ad tracking via Cookies became a hot topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users were
 upset with the practice and asking for change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracking across 
websites was certainly not what cookies were designed to do, they were 
designed with the opposite intention, but what could be done at that point to fix the problem? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 One of the solutions we came up with was to add controls to give
 each user control over what cookies to accept and from whom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big
 question at the time was whether or not to disable 3rd party cookies completely or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision had wide ranging effects since advertising was paying for most of the web and disabling 3rd party cookies would also disable many legitimate uses for cookies on embedded resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br>
<b>An uncomfortable decision</b><br>
In the end the decision to disable 3rd party cookies or keep them on was
 left to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agonized about the decision for weeks and in the end I
 chose to keep them.&nbsp;&nbsp; My logic was two fold: 
</p><blockquote>
Any company that had the ability to track users across a 
large section of the web would need to be a large publicly visible 
company.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies could be seen by users so a tracking company can't 
hide from the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way the public has a natural feedback 
mechanism to constrain those that would seek to track them.<p>
If 3rd party cookies were disabled ad companies would use another 
mechanism to accomplish the same thing, and that mechanism would not 
have the same level of visibility and control as cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp; We would be 
trading out one problem for another.</p></blockquote><p>
Today, I still believe that it was the correct decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Governments
 have an ability to regulate the collection of data by large visible 
companies and has shown a willingness to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public has a 
responsibility to keep pressure on both the companies that have the 
ability to track users and governments to enact reasonable privacy 
regulations and enforce them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly, there are other 
mechanisms that can replace Web cookies for tracking if they are 
universally disabled, and those mechanisms would be much harder to 
observe and disable.
<br>
<b>Durability</b><br>
The design of Cookies have remained fairly unchanged for the last 19 
years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest changes have been to how users can view and control
 their cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people have proposed alternatives, but none 
have caught on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies are not perfect, but they have certainly 
proved good enough and much of the functionality of the web depends on 
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br>
<b>Summary</b><br>
Web Cookies find themselves in the midst of a very controversial area, 
and have gained a level of notoriety because of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though they 
were designed to protect privacy they have been used in ways that are 
sometimes infringing upon it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many efforts have been taken to protect
 the privacy of Web users and Cookie controls have been put into the hands of every 
user.&nbsp; &nbsp; The future of Cookies and user privacy is surely to continue as
 an interesting news item for a very long time and rightfully so. &nbsp;&nbsp; The nature of the advertising business is to collect as much information as it possibly can, so the public needs to push back when it goes too far.&nbsp;
