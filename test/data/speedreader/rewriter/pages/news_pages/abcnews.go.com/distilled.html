He said DeSantis took his client out of office "because of policy differences [and] because the governor would like to do his job differently than Mr. Warren wants to do his job."</p><p>"Those are not bases for which the governor can suspend Warren," Cabou added.</p><p>DeSantis did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment on the lawsuit. After he suspended Warren on Aug. 4, the governor said in a statement that "state attorneys have a duty to prosecute crimes as defined in Florida law, not to pick and choose which laws to enforce based on his personal agenda."</p><p>The governor also touted his decision to remove Warren from office while on the campaign trail this week.</p><p>"Out of 20 elected prosecutors, we found one who decided to put himself above the law, saying he didn't have to enforce laws that he disagreed with," he said during a speech in Carlsbad, New Mexico, on Sunday.</p><p>Warren has signed two joint statements pledging not to prosecute crimes related to abortion and gender-transition treatments for children. By doing so, DeSantis claims, Warren has neglected his duty and demonstrated incompetence.</p><p>DeSantis signed a law in April that bans abortions in Florida after a 15-week gestation period. The law went into effect on July 1, a week after the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-rules-major-case-involving-abortion-rights/story?id=85160781" tabindex="0" target="_self">overturned Roe v.

The plaintiffs argue the law violates the state constitution.</p><p>There is currently no law in Florida that criminalizes gender-related treatment for minors, although some state legislators have pushed for one. The state's Agency for Health Care Administration recently passed a rule barring transgender residents from using Medicaid to pay for gender-affirming care.</p><div><div><figure><img alt="PHOTO: Andrew Warren, who was removed from his elected post as Hillsborough's state attorney by Gov.
