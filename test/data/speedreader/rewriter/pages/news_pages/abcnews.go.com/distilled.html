He said DeSantis took his client out of office "because of policy differences [and] because the governor would like to do his job differently than Mr. Warren wants to do his job."</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB wqIGQ ">"Those are not bases for which the governor can suspend Warren," Cabou added.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB wqIGQ ">DeSantis did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment on the lawsuit. After he suspended Warren on Aug. 4, the governor said in a statement that "state attorneys have a duty to prosecute crimes as defined in Florida law, not to pick and choose which laws to enforce based on his personal agenda."</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB wqIGQ ">The governor also touted his decision to remove Warren from office while on the campaign trail this week.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB wqIGQ ">"Out of 20 elected prosecutors, we found one who decided to put himself above the law, saying he didn't have to enforce laws that he disagreed with," he said during a speech in Carlsbad, New Mexico, on Sunday.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB wqIGQ ">Warren has signed two joint statements pledging not to prosecute crimes related to abortion and gender-transition treatments for children. By doing so, DeSantis claims, Warren has neglected his duty and demonstrated incompetence.</p><p class="fnmMv geuMB alqtB wqIGQ ">DeSantis signed a law in April that bans abortions in Florida after a 15-week gestation period. The law went into effect on July 1, a week after the U.S. Supreme Court <a class="  uOtk efBMc LIsPj wIScF " href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-rules-major-case-involving-abortion-rights/story?id=85160781" tabindex="0" target="_self">overturned Roe v.
