It’s the first time the annual limit has increased since 2002, the IRS confirmed in a news release last week. &nbsp;</p><p>The previous limit was $250 annually. The ceiling is set to&nbsp;rise in $50 increments based on inflation, according to the IRS. The agency confirmed to USA TODAY that inflation adjustments are typically annual <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|inline click|${u}">and apply to a slate of tax policies.</a> &nbsp;</p><p>People eligible for the deduction include K-12 teachers, other instructors, counselors, principals or aides in a school for at least 900 hours during the school year. Educators may work at public or private schools, and they can deduct costs that haven’t been reimbursed for books, computer equipment, COVID-19 protective items such as hand soap and face masks and more. &nbsp;</p><p>Educators can still take the deduction if they take the standard deduction on their personal taxes. If an educator is married and files&nbsp;a joint return with another eligible educator, they are able to deduct up to $600, but not more than $300 for each person.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Florida:</strong><a href="/story/tech/2022/08/16/google-doodle-contest-winner-florida/10337692002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:7|${u}">High school student wins Google Doodle contest by showcasing her mother's support</a></p><p><strong>California:</strong><a href="/story/news/education/2022/08/12/california-schools-students-free-breakfast-lunch/10308587002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|spike click:8|${u}">Schools to provide free breakfast, lunch for students in first statewide meals program</a></p><p>Some states also offer deductions for teachers purchasing classroom materials and other essentials.
