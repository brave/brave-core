Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake has made headlines this year as a prominent <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/08/kari-lake-wins-arizona-election/" target="_blank">election denier</a>. It has now become apparent that she's anything but an erection denier. <br>
<br>
On Sunday, during a rally in downtown Phoenix that featured an appearance from GOP idol du jour Ron DeSantis, Lake praised the Florida governor, describing him as "gutsy." Pretending to search for the most fitting way to characterize DeSantis, Lake, former Phoenix TV news anchor turned far-right candidate for her state's highest office, continued, "The guy has bigger... Wait, let me think about how I want to word this. My staff always says, ‚ÄòWhatever you do, do not say "balls."' So I'm not going to say it. That guy has a backbone made of steel."<br>
<br>
She wasn't finished.<br>
<br>
"I'll tell you what he's got. I don't know if you've heard of this, but he's got the B-D-E," Lake went on. "Anybody know what that means? Ask your kids about it later. I call it 'Big DeSantis Energy.' Right? He's got the same kind of BDE that President Trump has."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Kari Lake says Desantis has ‚ÄòBDE,‚Äô (Big Dick Energy), the same kind of BDE that Trump has. ‚ÄúHe has the same BDE that we want all of our leaders to have.‚Äù <a href="https://t.co/hcFlNiRrCn">pic.twitter.com/hcFlNiRrCn</a></p>‚Äî Ron Filipkowski üá∫üá¶ (@RonFilipkowski) <a href="https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1559126126760443905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2022</a></blockquote> <p><i>New Times</i> had never heard of Big DeSantis Energy.<br>
<br>
Some of us, however, are familiar with BDE, which in popular parlance stands for "Big Dick Energy." (Kids today, right?!) It's a term that describes a person who's&nbsp;confident, but not cocky. <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Big%20Dick%20Energy" target="_blank">Urban Dictionary</a>&nbsp;sums it up as&nbsp;"the loud and boisterous energy emitted by someone who has a colossal phallus and doesn't have to tell anyone about it.... People with big dick energy possess qualities such as leadership, kindness, positivity towards others, great humor, and a 'don't fuck with me' aura. Great hair too."<br>
<br>
Dunno about y'all, but to our ears, none of that screams "Ron DeSantis" ‚Äî a man who has been variously described as&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/25/opinions/desantis-trump-ben-ghiat/index.html" target="_blank">"mini-Trump" </a>and a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/03/ron-densantis-students-masks" target="_blank">"smug asshole" </a>and has earned headlines for <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2022-03-02/florida-governor-admonishes-students-for-wearing-face-masks" target="_blank">yelling at kids</a>, for heaven's sake.<br>
<br>
Perhaps not surprisingly, many on social media were quick to disagree with Lake's assessment of the governor's putative dimensions. <br>

"Tell me you don't know what real BDE is without telling me you don't know what real BDE is," quipped <i>Atlantic</i> contributing writer Jemele Hill.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tell me you don‚Äôt know what real BDE is without telling me you don‚Äôt know what real BDE is. <a href="https://t.co/ZSSonfHlYt">https://t.co/ZSSonfHlYt</a></p>‚Äî Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) <a href="https://twitter.com/jemelehill/status/1559207904065990656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2022</a></blockquote> <p> &nbsp;"Ron is the kind of governor you want to Netflix and chill with, right?
