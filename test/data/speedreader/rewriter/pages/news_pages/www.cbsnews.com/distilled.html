<p><em>Marhenets, Ukraine</em>&nbsp;— It was a sweet little room, really. One of those cozy kitchen-dining rooms. The stovetop and oven were a little outdated, the countertop a bit tired and the wooden cabinets maybe could have used a lick of paint. But the top floor apartment faced a grand square in central Marhenets, with a view of the Cultural Palace next door and the fields beyond. </p><p>What a view. Bright summer afternoon sunlight poured into the room.</p><p>It was easy to imagine the meals, the laughter and joy shared between family members and friends in that room. There was a warmth about the place. </p>

She was sweeping up dust from the gaping, 25-foot hole in her wall left by a <span class="link"><a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/ukraine-crisis/">Russian rocket that tore her home and her life to pieces</a></span> a few nights before.</p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img alt="marhenets-ukraine-shelling.jpg " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/16/c13626be-5873-4b58-a812-7d686ad3cc6c/thumbnail/620x327/3591416e70d066ad463b139dd1f9f683/marhenets-ukraine-shelling.jpg 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/16/c13626be-5873-4b58-a812-7d686ad3cc6c/thumbnail/1240x654/c484691560f6335acc7c6792e3e316f4/marhenets-ukraine-shelling.jpg 2x" height="327" src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/16/c13626be-5873-4b58-a812-7d686ad3cc6c/thumbnail/620x327/3591416e70d066ad463b139dd1f9f683/marhenets-ukraine-shelling.jpg#" srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/16/c13626be-5873-4b58-a812-7d686ad3cc6c/thumbnail/620x327/3591416e70d066ad463b139dd1f9f683/marhenets-ukraine-shelling.jpg 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/16/c13626be-5873-4b58-a812-7d686ad3cc6c/thumbnail/1240x654/c484691560f6335acc7c6792e3e316f4/marhenets-ukraine-shelling.jpg 2x" width="620"></span>

Falling 70 feet or more to the ground below would have been much worse.</p>

    

<p>That top floor, with the marvelous view that made the apartment so special, also left it exposed and vulnerable to the Russian rockets that hit Marhenets and other towns the bank of the Dnipro River every night.

They're close enough to hear the launches, and they say that when they do, they only have around seven seconds to try and take cover; not nearly enough time to trigger air raid alarms, let alone run for a shelter.</p><p>City officials showed us a destroyed building, one block over, where they say 13 people were killed that same night. A missile pierced the roof and blew up, killing people in their sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a new bombardment every night, they say, typically, in the early hours, from around one to four in the morning. Some of the few residents left in cities like Marhenets and Nikopol along the Dnipro spend the nights in basements or stairwells for safety.</p>

    
    

<p>Explosions rang out as we visited both of those places. At the shortest point, it's only about three miles across the river to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Some of it sounded like it outgoing rounds. Some definitely sounded like incoming. </p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img alt="UKRAINE-RUSSIA-CONFLICT " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/08/61386f94-1127-408e-8a58-e03e85ce605a/thumbnail/620x413/d248e7c31978ab459e4ea55fd536d342/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-1240384587.jpg 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/08/61386f94-1127-408e-8a58-e03e85ce605a/thumbnail/1240x826/ead20118e9973af0adda73810d7d7fa5/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-1240384587.jpg 2x" height="413" src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/08/61386f94-1127-408e-8a58-e03e85ce605a/thumbnail/620x413/d248e7c31978ab459e4ea55fd536d342/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-1240384587.jpg#" srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/08/61386f94-1127-408e-8a58-e03e85ce605a/thumbnail/620x413/d248e7c31978ab459e4ea55fd536d342/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-1240384587.jpg 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/08/61386f94-1127-408e-8a58-e03e85ce605a/thumbnail/1240x826/ead20118e9973af0adda73810d7d7fa5/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-1240384587.jpg 2x" width="620"></span>

</figure><p>At the moment, that looks like a long shot. It's on the very edge of Russian-held territory, right on the banks of the Dnipro River. It couldn't be more frontline. That's what makes the cities on the Ukrainian side so vulnerable.</p><p>Whether the fighting at and around the plant is truly flirting with Armageddon — whether a modern nuclear power station is capable of withstanding the blows of an active combat zone — are questions best left to the experts. Engineers have been quoted as saying that the three-foot-thick containment structures should protect the plant's reactors from even direct hits. But it's not clear if sustained shelling could damage the infrastructure, or shut down power supplies and backup generators, or spark a fire.</p><p>The unanswered questions have certainly put everyone living in the shadow of the plant on edge. </p><p>"People are afraid," Nikopol's Deputy Mayor, Natalia Horbolit, told us.
