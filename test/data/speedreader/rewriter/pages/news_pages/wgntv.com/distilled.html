<p>MIAMI. (<a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/10-year-old-loses-part-of-leg-after-8-foot-shark-attack-in-florida-keys-reports/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">WFLA</a>) — A 10-year-old boy is recovering after a shark attack left him without part of his leg, according to reports.</p>



<p>The boy, Jameson Reeder Jr., was on vacation with his parents and three siblings in the Florida Keys, a spokesperson with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission told <a href="https://www.keysnews.com/news/boy-10-bitten-by-shark-at-looe-key-reef/article_d5fc467c-1ca5-11ed-988d-47f2eff2ce27.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Keys News</a>.</p>





<p>The family had been snorkeling at Looe Key Reef on Saturday afternoon when the shark bit the boy on his lower right leg, the FWC said.</p>



<p>According to Jameson’s uncle, Joshua Reeder, the family believed the boy was attacked by an 8-foot bull shark. Wildlife officials haven’t shared any details about the shark. </p>



<p>“As he screamed and cried for help while miraculously staying afloat on a noodle, my brother [Jameson Reeder Sr.] gathered his family on the boat and rushed over to rescue his son,” Joshua Reeder <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joshuareeder1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">wrote on Facebook</a>.</p>



<p>The family managed to get their 10-year-old back on their boat and put a tourniquet on his leg. </p>







<p>Reeder said the family was able to get help from another boat with a nurse onboard, which took the boy and his mother to shore. Paramedics then took the child to a hospital for help.</p>



<p>Doctors had to amputate the boy’s right leg below the knee due to the level of damage caused by the shark, according to his uncle.</p>



<p>“He is now out of surgery and resting and has now had the news of what all took place,” Joshua Reeder said. </p>



<p>A spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission confirmed the shark attack to the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article264517296.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Miami Herald</a>, but additional details have not yet been released. </p>
