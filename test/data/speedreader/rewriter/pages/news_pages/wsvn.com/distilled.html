					<p>COCONUT CREEK, FLA. (WSVN) - Students in Broward County are on their way through those school doors to begin the first day of school.</p><p>Planning ahead is crucial in these times as buses and parent drivers are to fill the streets with traffic for student pickup and dropoff.</p><p>Bus drivers were seen getting ready for the routes in the lot as the superintendent of Broward County Public Schools, Dr. Vickie Cartwright, spoke to parents and students, Tuesday morning.</p><p>“For every single bus that you see, we have a route,” said Cartwright. “We do have a bus driver on every one of our routes this morning. So, that is a permanent bus driver, rather than substitutes or having to combine bus routes. We are 100% staffed on that.”</p><p>The superintendent also added that there is a certified teacher in every core academic classroom for students on this first day of school.</p><p>Parents prepared on the eve of the new academic school year as they dropped by South Florida stores for last-minute school supplies and clothes for their kids.</p><p>7News spoke to some children who were spotted shopping with their parents.</p><p>Kataryna and Aleksander Kijner are starting the fifth grade today and yesterday they shopped for school essentials.</p><p>“Five-minute subject books,” said Kataryna. “Papers,” interrupted Aleksander.</p><p>“Some uniforms,” Kataryna said as she thought of what else they may need.</p><p>“And right now we’re going to get the label for the uniforms,” added Aleksander.</p><p>Scott Benrube​ showed off his school shorts for his first day as an eighth grader after shopping and he shared his feelings on summer coming to an end.</p><p>“I get to meet new people this year and, but also, I wish it was still longer so I could play more basketball,” said Benrube.</p><p>Everyone got ready for a fresh start in their academics; even the superintendent got pumped.</p><p>“Tomorrow is the big day and boy, I’m so excited,” said Cartwright.</p><p>The Broward Education Foundation and Office Depot teamed up to hand out bookbags and supplies, <a data-id="https://wsvn.com/news/local/broward-county-schools-hold-events-to-prepare-for-upcoming-school-year/" data-type="URL" href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/broward-county-schools-hold-events-to-prepare-for-upcoming-school-year/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Monday</a>.</p><p>“They selected Markham Elementary School as one of their sites, they’re giving away 570 backpacks today plus a $20 gift card for their parents,” said Cartwright, who attended and spoke at the event.</p><p>Office Depot’s “Start Proud” program also raised money to help teachers, like Jaqueline Richards, with supplies.</p><p>“I’m going to put everything to good use,” said Richards.</p><p>As students shake off that first day of school nervousness, some looked forward to getting good grades and learning new subjects in the new year.</p>
