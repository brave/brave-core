Broadway have sat vacant for about 40 years.</p>
<p>But that may soon change.</p>
<p>The three-story, 17,688-square-foot building changed hands at the end of July. GM Development, led by Ben Gearhart and Charles Moore, purchased the space for $3.4 million, or about $192 a square foot, according to public records.</p>
<p>A pawn shop occupies the first floor of the building, and has a lease that runs through 2026, Gearhart said. The upper floors, however, have been unused since the early 1980s.</p>	
<p>The building was originally the Burte Hotel. GM plans to convert the 40 rooms on the second and third floors into 20 one-bedroom and studio apartments. Leasing will probably begin next summer, Gearhart said.</p>
<p>“With such large increases in rent growth and a high need for attainable units, we felt this project was a perfect fit for a conversion,” he said. “We are working with the National Park Service and the state to help with tax incentives to be able to offer a more attainable product.”</p>
<p>The National Park Service oversees the National Register of Historic Places, on which Gearhart hopes to get the building listed.</p>
<p>Gearhart said he is looking at building out the rooftop so tenants can get views of the mountains and downtown.</p>
<p>The Burte Hotel was first planned in 1909 and built by Gustave Burte sometime that same year or the early 1910s, according to an old newspaper story. The project cost $38,000.</p>	

<p>In today’s dollars, that would be around $1.2 million.</p>
<p>Before the hotel became vacant, it would often be used to house auto parts vendors who had come to town to sell their products, Gearhart said.</p>
<p>GM Development recently sold a former funeral home in Berkeley to a Montessori school. The firm also fixed up a former hostel in the Uptown neighborhood.</p>
<p>The building was sold by Trevor Pettennude, who runs a Denver-based company that provides credit card payment systems to businesses. Pettennude purchased the space in January 2014 for $925,000, records show.</p>
