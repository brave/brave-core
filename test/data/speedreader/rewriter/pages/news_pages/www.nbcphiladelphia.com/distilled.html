<p>Phillies star Bryce Harper hasn't taken an in-game swing at Citizens Bank Park since June 15 as the MVP has spent the summer recovering from thumb surgery.</p>

<p>But on Monday the reigning NL MVP shared a brief, four-second clip to his Instagram story that should have Phillies fans everywhere fired up as the team enters a playoff push over its final 48 games.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/phillies/bryce-harper-rehab-assignment-phillies-injuries?chrcontext=WCAU" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>MORE:&nbsp;Harper&nbsp;could start rehab assignment next week</strong></a></p>

<p>Harper was in the batting cages down in South Philly on Monday, getting a batting practice session in at CBP while his teammates are on the road in Cincinnati:</p>

<p>Watching Harper swing a bat - even if it's just one swing, completely removed from actual game action - is music to fans' ears. (Music to fans' eyes? Is that... a thing? You know what I mean.)</p>

<p>The Phillies have successfully stayed in the Wild Card race (and even been a Top 10 in Major League Baseball) in Harper's absence, but the past weekend's anemic series against the NL East-leading Mets was a reminder that this team needs more talent in the lineup to compete with the sport's best squads come the postseason.</p>

<p>Harper's bat can provide that kind of jolt.</p>


<p>Around the time of his surgery, the Phillies' <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/phillies/bryce-harper-surgery-thumb-phillies?chrcontext=WCAU" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">hope was that</a> Harper could return to the lineup by Sept. 1. That date is just over two weeks away. Phillies President of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski <a href="https://twitter.com/alannarizzo/status/1559231804598636544" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">appeared on MLB Network on Monday</a> and called that date "realistic" and said that, when Harper returns, he'll be the team's designated hitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of multiple injuries this season, Harper has spent just eight games in right field. He appeared as the DH 55 times before the surgery.</p>

<p>Here's more on Harper's timeline towards a return <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/phillies/bryce-harper-injury-update-kyle-schwarber-cincinnati?chrcontext=WCAU" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">from NBC Sports Philadelphia's Jim Salisbury</a>:</p>

<p><em><strong>"Harper will reach an important step in his recovery from a broken left thumb when he starts taking batting practice at Citizens Bank Park on Monday. If all goes well after a few days of BP, Harper could start seeing high velocity from a pitching machine in the indoor cages. That would be the final step before heading out to a minor-league affiliate for some competitive at-bats.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>"Harper, who was injured on June 25, has pointed toward a 'September-ish' return. His thumb is completely healed. He is pretty much in the driverâ€™s seat as to when he wants to go out on minor-league rehab. The determining factor will be when he feels ready to see competitive, live pitching so just taking batting practice is an important step."</strong></em></p>

<p>So, to recap: Harper's back swinging a bat at CBP, Dombrowski says Sept. 1 is realistic, and the Fightins have a series against the lowly Reds on tap.</p>

<p>Sounds like it's time for the Phils to turn it on.</p>
