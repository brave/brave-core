<p><span><abbr class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent">A</abbr></span> shock ran through the sporting world last week when a group led by Walmart heir Rob Walton won the bidding war for the Denver Broncos NFL team <a aria-label="with a $4.65 billion offer" class="color-link" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2022/06/08/group-led-by-walmart-heir-rob-walton-agrees-to-buy-denver-broncos-for-465-billion/?sh=5a479d027c2b" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2022/06/08/group-led-by-walmart-heir-rob-walton-agrees-to-buy-denver-broncos-for-465-billion/?sh=5a479d027c2b" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2022/06/08/group-led-by-walmart-heir-rob-walton-agrees-to-buy-denver-broncos-for-465-billion/?sh=5a479d027c2b">with a $4.65 billion offer</a>. The eye-popping sum made the deal the most expensive sports team purchase in history and turned a spotlight on the man at the center of it all: the typically low-profile Walton. The eldest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton, he inherited his fortune and served as Walmart’s chairman for 23 years. Now worth $57.2 billion, he is the 15th richest person in America and the fifth richest U.S. heir. </p>

<p>A handful of Rob Walton’s relatives are among America’s richest people as well. Founded in 1962 by Sam and his brother James “Bud” Walton, Walmart, the country’s largest retailer, is still about half owned by members of the family. Seven have fortunes of $10 billion or more, including Sam Walton’s three living children–Rob, Jim and Alice—and grandson Lukas. (The eighth Walmart billionaire, Christy Walton, the widow of Sam’s late son John, is worth an estimated $7 billion.) </p>

<p>Tremendous family wealth is a hallmark of <em>Forbes’</em> list of the country’s richest people, though many billionaire heirs hail from just a handful of companies. One such company is agriculture giant Cargill, the <a aria-label="largest private company in the country" class="color-link" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/largest-private-companies/list/" href="https://www.forbes.com/largest-private-companies/list/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/largest-private-companies/list/">largest private company in the country</a>, which has propelled 12 heirs into the three comma club. The great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren of founder W. W. Cargill still own nearly 90% of the business he founded in 1865. </p>

<p>Other businesses where the spoils of success have trickled down the generations include the Wisconsin-based cleaning products manufacturer SC Johnson–known for brands like Windex, Off and Pledge–and Mars, the candy and pet food empire started by Frank Mars in 1911. The four great-great-grandchildren of Samuel Curtis Johnson–H. Fisk Johnson, Helen Johnson-Leipold, S. Curtis Johnson and Winifred J. Marquart–collectively own a majority of the private company and are worth an estimated $3.1 billion each, while six of founder Mars’ grandchildren and great-grandchildren are billionaires, worth between $7.4 billion and $29.7 billion, <em>Forbes</em> estimates. </p>


<fbs-ad ad-id="article-0-top" position="top" progressive=""></fbs-ad>
<p>Some of these heirs took control of businesses they inherited and radically transformed them. Charles Koch and his three brothers inherited most of a vastly smaller Koch Industries when their father, Fred, died in 1967. (Charles and his brother David (d. 2019) bought out the stakes of their two brothers, Frederick and Bill, for $1.1 billion in 1983.) Charles has run the company since the death of his father, orchestrating the $13 billion acquisition of Georgia Pacific in 2005 and the estimated $13 billion purchase of cloud software firm Infor in 2020, among others. Charles Koch appeared on the first Forbes 400 list of richest Americans in 1982 with a net worth of $266 million. <em>Forbes</em> now pegs his fortune at just under $60 billion. Rupert Murdoch inherited two Australian newspapers when his father died–and with those started a media empire that has grown to include Fox News, arguably the most influential cable TV network in the U.S.</p>
<p>Together the country’s 20 richest billionaire heirs (technically there are 23 because several are tied at number 20) are worth $568 billion. That’s about 13.5% of the $4.2 trillion in wealth of all 701 U.S. billionaires, according to <em>Forbes</em>’ estimates. Here’s a look at who they are and where their money comes from. (Net worths are as of Thursday, June 16.)</p>
