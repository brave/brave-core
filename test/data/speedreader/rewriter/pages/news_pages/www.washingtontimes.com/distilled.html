                      <p>The bulletin warned of talk to place a dirty bomb in front of <a href="/topics/federal-bureau-of-investigation/">FBI</a> headquarters and “general calls” for a civil war and armed rebellion. Investigators also are monitoring threats against the federal judge who approved the warrant to search Mr. Trump’s residence.<p>The bulletin comes as Rep.
