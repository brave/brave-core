<p>"Be proud of yourselves kids for being kind, respectful, and helpful to all your fellow peers, teachers and staff," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ChWQ08ROVZ0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she wrote on Instagram</a>&nbsp;on Aug. 17, along with a photo of the octuplets all standing in a line and smiling. "You are exceptional role models to the 6th and 7th graders. I&nbsp;love you."</p>
<p>Suleman—who now goes by <strong>Natalie</strong>—also addressed why her other six children were not featured in the photograph, adding, "Side note to critics: their older siblings did not want me to post a picture on their first day. I respect their choice, so should you."</p>
<p>The 47-year-old&nbsp;is also mom to <strong>Elijah</strong>, 21,&nbsp;<strong>Ameerah</strong>, 20,&nbsp;<strong>Joshua</strong>, 19,&nbsp;<strong>Aidan</strong>, 16 and twins <strong>Calyssa</strong> and <strong>Caleb</strong>, 15.</p></div></div></section><section class="article-detail__segment"><div class="article-detail__text-only" data-testid="segment-text-only"><p>The sweet social media post comes seven months after Suleman paid tribute to the&nbsp;octuplets as they <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/1317954/octomom-nadya-suleman-celebrates-her-kids-13th-birthday-and-now-we-feel-old" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">celebrated their milestone 13th birthdays</a>.</p></div></section><section class="article-detail__segment"><div class="article-detail__photo-text "><p><span class="article-detail__image-agency" data-hook="adp-photo-agency">Instagram</span></p><div class="article-detail__text-only" data-testid="segment-text-only"><p>"You are all growing into some of the most kind, humble, grateful and loving human beings I have ever known," she wrote on Jan. 28., along with&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZNyU3xpnE0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">throwback photo</a> of her kids. "Each of you possess rare and unique characteristics, and are unlike any other child of your age, particularly in our society today."</p>
<p>She continued: "I have never seen children who love and want to serve others, (particularly those less fortunate), so boldly and confidently like each and every one of you do. I do not know what I could possibly have done to deserve being blessed so bountifully."&nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;in 2009, Suleman&nbsp;made headlines when she welcomed her octuplets in California.&nbsp;Nicknamed "Octomom" by the press, the&nbsp;single mom&nbsp;was thrusted into the spotlight. In the years following, Suleman made numerous TV appearance and&nbsp;even <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/398930/octomom-nadya-suleman-says-making-porn-video-was-liberating-and-empowering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made an adult film</a>. &nbsp;</p></div></div></section><section class="article-detail__segment"><div class="article-detail__text-only" data-testid="segment-text-only"><p>In a profile for the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/style/octomom-kids-2018.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York Times</a></em>, published in 2018, Suleman opened up about the person she said she was was during the intense media spotlight.</p>
<p>"I was pretending to be a fake, a caricature, which is something I'm not, and I was doing it out of desperation and scarcity so I could provide for my family," shared Suleman. "I've been hiding from the real world all my life."</p></div></section><section class="article-detail__segment"><div class="article-detail__photo-text "><p><span class="article-detail__image-agency" data-hook="adp-photo-agency">Jeff Fusco/Getty Images</span></p><div class="article-detail__text-only" data-testid="segment-text-only"><p>In the profile, Suleman insisted she "<a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/997260/octomom-10-years-later-nadya-suleman-says-she-never-wanted-the-attention" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never wanted the attention</a>," and suffers from PTSD&nbsp;as a result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I would take whatever I could back in the days, and I would let them in," she continued, "I was spiraling down a dark hole. There were no healthy opportunities for Octomom. I was doing what I was told to do and saying what I was told to say. When you're pretending to be something you're not, at least for me, you end up falling on your face."</p></div></div></section><section class="article-detail__segment"><div class="article-detail__text-only" data-testid="segment-text-only"><p>These days,&nbsp;Suleman prefers to live her life away from the spotlight and focus on her family.</p>
<p>"Octomom was media created. I believe most media is filtered and fake. They created this caricature," Suleman told the <em>NYT.</em> "Once I finally ran away from all of the pretending, I was able to be me."</p></div></section></body>
