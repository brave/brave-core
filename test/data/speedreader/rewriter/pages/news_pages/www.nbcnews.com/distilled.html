"The law would give them complete immunity based solely on their status as federal officials." </p><p>Last, the judge said Graham's reasoning for being exempt from testifying because he's a high-ranking official also doesn't carry weight. Willis has shown that "extraordinary circumstances" necessitated the testimony of Graham, who has "unique personal knowledge about the substance and circumstances of the phone calls with Georgia election officials, as well as the logistics of setting them up and his actions afterward," May said.</p><p>"Senator Graham’s potential testimony on these issues — in addition to his knowledge about topics outside of the calls such as his alleged coordination with the Trump campaign before and after the calls are unique to Senator Graham, and Senator Graham has not suggested that anyone else from his office can speak to these issues or has unique personal knowledge of them," the order said. </p><p>Graham's office released a statement saying he will appeal the judge's decision.</p><p>"The Constitution’s speech or debate clause prevents a local official from questioning a senator about how that senator did his job," the statement said.&nbsp;"Here, Senator Graham was doing his due diligence before the Electoral Count Act certification vote — where he voted to certify the election.&nbsp;Although the district court acknowledged that speech or debate may protect some of Senator Graham’s activities, she nevertheless ignored the constitutional text and binding Supreme Court precedent, so Senator Graham plans to appeal to the 11th&nbsp;Circuit."</p><p>Willis is looking into Graham’s call to Raffensperger in the days after the November 2020 election. Raffensperger has said<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/georgia-secretary-state-raffensperger-says-sen-graham-asked-him-about-n1247968"> Graham pressed him </a>about whether he had the power to reject certain absentee ballots, which Raffensperger said he interpreted as a suggestion to toss out legally cast votes.</p><p>The subpoena seeking Graham's testimony said he "made at least two telephone calls" to Raffensperger and his staff. "During the telephone calls, [Graham] questioned Secretary Raffensperger and his staff about reexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump. [Graham] also made reference to allegations of widespread voter fraud in the November 2020 election in Georgia, consistent with public statements made by known affiliates of the Trump Campaign," the subpoena said.</p><div><div><p>Rebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.</p></div><div><p>Tom Winter is a New York-based correspondent covering crime, courts, terrorism and financial fraud on the East Coast for the NBC News Investigative Unit.</p></div><div><p>Frank Thorp V</p> <p>contributed</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></article></main></body>
