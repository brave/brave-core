          <p>Hits: 995</p><p>At <a href="https://www.kewforest.org">Kew-Forest</a>, you will find a community that nurtures lifelong learners, educators who inspire young people, and students who support each other. Established in 1918, <strong>The Kew-Forest School</strong> is the oldest independent co-ed, college preparatory school in Queens. Families and staff represent <strong>70+ nationalities</strong> and speak <strong>30+ languages.</strong></p>
<p>The School’s small size allows it to be nimble and quick in response to individual needs of students as well as challenges faced in education today. While <strong>all learning</strong> is taking place <strong>on campus in-person </strong>for the 2021-22 school year, the School is poised to transition to a remote learning platform if the need arises for all students in <strong>Preschool through Grade 12</strong>.</p>
