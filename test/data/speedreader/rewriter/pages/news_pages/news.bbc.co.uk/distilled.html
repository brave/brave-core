The injuries were mainly related to the blast so there were shells inside the bodies and burning injuries all over the bodies of the victims".</p><p>He said he believed the blast was inside the mosque. "There was probably someone entering during the prayer time, so it was crowded at that moment and then [the attacker] activated this body burning improvised explosive device. </p><p>"So that all the persons that were close to the attacker were basically dead and the ones all around received several injuries," Mr Sozza added.</p><div data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="IS-focus-seems-to-be-widening"><span role="text">IS focus seems to be widening</span></h2></div><p>The mosque was crowded, the bomb powerful, and another cleric seems to have been in the sights of IS (Islamic State), the group which has emerged as the Taliban's most potent enemy.</p><p>In the past month, three prominent religious leaders were targeted in Kabul and there were assassinations in other cities.</p><p>Last week it was Sheikh Rahimullah Haqqani, known to be close to the Taliban.
