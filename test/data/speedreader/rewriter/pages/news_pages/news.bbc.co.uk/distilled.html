The mosque's imam is reported to be among the dead.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">It is unclear who was behind the attack, a week after a prominent so-called Islamic State (IS) militants killed a pro-Taliban cleric in a suicide bomb blast, also in Kabul. </p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Security forces have now sealed off the blast scene in Kabul.  </p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Witnesses described hearing a powerful explosion which shattered windows in nearby buildings.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"I saw that so many people were killed, even people were thrown out of the windows of the mosque," one eyewitness told Reuters news agency.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Stefano Sozza, the head of the medical charity Emergency, which runs the city's main hospital, told the BBC his group had already treated 35 people, including children.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"Our doctors... operated the patients in need of surgical assistance all night long. The injuries were mainly related to the blast so there were shells inside the bodies and burning injuries all over the bodies of the victims".</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">He said he believed the blast was inside the mosque. "There was probably someone entering during the prayer time, so it was crowded at that moment and then [the attacker] activated this body burning improvised explosive device. </p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">"So that all the persons that were close to the attacker were basically dead and the ones all around received several injuries," Mr Sozza added.</p><div class="ssrcss-dm4ypg-ComponentWrapper-HeadlineComponentWrapper egtrm1f0" data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 class="ssrcss-y2fd7s-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10" id="IS-focus-seems-to-be-widening" tabindex="-1"><span role="text">IS focus seems to be widening</span></h2></div><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">The mosque was crowded, the bomb powerful, and another cleric seems to have been in the sights of IS (Islamic State), the group which has emerged as the Taliban's most potent enemy.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">In the past month, three prominent religious leaders were targeted in Kabul and there were assassinations in other cities.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Last week it was Sheikh Rahimullah Haqqani, known to be close to the Taliban. This time it's Amir Muhammad Kabuli, said to be an adherent of the more moderate Sufi faith. </p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">Video posted on social media showed a scene of carnage.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">One religious student who was just outside the mosque told the BBC he saw the bodies of the dead and injured sprawled inside, including children attending evening prayers.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph eq5iqo00">IS's signature has been its devastating attacks on the minority Shia Hazara community. But their focus now seems to be widening just as the Taliban celebrate their one year in power - a takeover which ended one chapter of a long bloody war but only ushered in yet another.  </p></body>
