People were hiding under the windows.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">They feared for their lives after a gunman <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-six-flags-great-america-shooting-20220815-rfadxybioreljaqnpbtqu5xtti-story.html" target="_blank">shot two people in the Gurnee amusement park’s parking lot</a> Sunday night.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">“The way people were panicking, it made us feel like the shooter was close by. And when we saw the police entering the park, we thought the shooter was loose somewhere inside,” the Kenosha resident said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">The shooting was not random and appeared to be targeted, Gurnee police said. No arrests had been made as of Monday, and police were still investigating, according to Shawn Gaylor, a spokesman for Gurnee police.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">But the gunshots sparked chaos, confusion and fear among hundreds of park visitors.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">Many fled to the same parking lot where shots were fired. Others hopped fences and tried to break open locked exit gates to escape.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">The bullets struck a 17-year-old Aurora boy in the upper thigh and hit a 19-year-old woman from Appleton, Wisconsin, in her lower leg, police said. Both shooting victims were treated at Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville for injuries not considered life-threatening and released Sunday night, police said. A third victim who suffered a shoulder injury declined additional treatment.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">After noticing the visitors taking shelter at the funnel cake stand, Tahir saw people running and heard yelling about the shooter. Her family ran to a bathroom, where an employee guided them to a hiding spot before escorting them out of the park 20 minutes later.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">She lied to her kids as they hid. The commotion was over fireworks, she told them. But the kids heard people yelling about the shooter.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">Tahir worries about them heading back to school in two weeks. She knows that no place is safe, she said. The 32-year-old mother had talked with her children before about what to do if a gunman attacks their school. They need to be prepared wherever they go, she said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">“I feel helpless. I don’t know what to do to make the lawmakers understand that gun violence needs to end,” she said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">Authorities said a white sedan entered the parking lot of Six Flags about 7:50 p.m. and drove toward the front park entrance. Gurnee police said more than one person exited the sedan “and began shooting toward another individual in the parking lot.” After firing multiple times, they “got back in the white sedan and quickly left the area,” according to a news release from Gurnee police.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">“This was not an active shooter incident inside the park,” police wrote.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">Eddie Cardenas was with his fiancée and their three kids when his mother-in-law called. She had left the park for the car to get a head start on prepping food.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">“Stay inside the park. There’s a shooter out here. There’s a shooter out here. There’s bodies falling,” she cried into the phone after watching the shooting unfold.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">Shocked by the news, Cardenas and his fiancée began to plan. But then dozens of people started running, Cardenas said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">“There’s a shooter! There’s a shooter! There’s a shooter!” he remembered hearing.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">The couple grabbed their kids — a 7-year-old boy, a 5-year-old boy and a 5-month-old girl — and started running. They took shelter behind the soaring Raging Bull steel coaster and took off again a few moments later.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">Their stroller was moving too slow, so Cardenas tossed it and put his 5-year-old on his shoulder. His fiancée left a purse behind, too. His 7-year-old son ran ahead and was almost lost in the confusion. Cardenas saw police with guns drawn. In a video he shared with the Tribune, people shrieked and tugged kids along.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">Outside the park, Cardenas regrouped with the nearly 30 family members he had joined for the Great America trip.<b> </b>He saw scared uncles waiting for their teens, who had split off earlier to go on rides.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">“We didn’t know,” the 30-year-old from Joliet said. “It was a huge panic.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">His 7-year-old said he didn’t want to go to Six Flags ever again.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">His 5-year-old threw his bright plastic toy guns into a trash bag Monday morning.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">“These are not toys,” he told his parents, according to Cardenas.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">His wife ordered the kids, who return to school soon, five-pound backpack shields.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">After the shooting, the family took a moment to pray in the car. One of Cardenas’ children thanked God that the family wasn’t killed.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">Cardenas began to cry.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">“The world that we live in, where our 5-year-old and 7-year-old have to be worried about shootings, being shot and dying, it’s scary. It’s a really scary world,” he said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">To protect Six Flags Great America, authorities use security cameras inside the park and in the parking lot, a Six Flags spokesperson said. Uniformed and plainclothes patrols monitor the park, which has a Gurnee Police Department substation on site.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">“Six Flags dedicates our greatest amount of time, talent and resources to safety and security,” Six Flags spokesperson Rachel Kendziora told the Tribune.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">“Layers of preventive measures both inside and outside the park are in place for the protection of guests and team members. … We are incredibly grateful to our team members who reacted in a professional manner to take care of our guests, and for the Gurnee Police Department for their ongoing presence and commitment to Six Flags Great America,” Kendziora said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">The Great America amusement park is an 18-mile drive from Highland Park, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-cb-highland-park-parade-shooting-20220705-yf3sayw6wrh5po7lucbooadylm-list.html" target="_blank">where a mass shooter opened fire on a crowd gathered for a Fourth of July parade</a>, killing seven and wounding dozens.</p><p class="interstitial-link block-margin-bottom"><span>[&nbsp;</span><a aria-label="Open related story" class="default__StyledLink-sc-1wxyvyl-1 hKsHty" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-highland-park-mass-shooting-crimo-arraignment-20220803-5c3vdrymszbotiwroeixks3evm-story.html#nt=interstitial-manual">Highland Park shooting: Man accused of killing 7 people at July Fourth parade pleads not guilty</a><span>&nbsp;]</span></p><p class="default__StyledText-sc-1wxyvyl-0 fxgoSg body-paragraph">Tane Walker was on a Highland Park parade float when the shooting happened.
