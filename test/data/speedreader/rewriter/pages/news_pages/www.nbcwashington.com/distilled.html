<p>The <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/ride-share-driver-crashed-into-arlington-pub-police/3132967/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">rideshare driver who slammed into an Irish pub</a> in Arlington, Virginia, injuring 15 people and sparking a fire, did not crash into the bar intentionally and they were not under the influence of alcohol, police said Monday.</p>

<p>Arlington County police said the driver, who they have not named, is cooperating with their investigation into the crash at Ireland’s Four Courts on Wilson Boulevard.</p>

<p>Nine people were hospitalized after the car slammed into the front of the pub, bulldozing the front bar early Friday evening.</p>

<p>One person remains in critical condition and two others are stable, police said Monday afternoon.</p>


<p>An owner of the pub told News4 earlier Monday they hoped to reopen one day.</p>

<p>“We’re a family restaurant,” Dave Cahill said. “Right now, we’re thinking of the families. It’s a lot to process.”</p>

<p>County survey teams were out Monday morning inspecting the damage in the bottom part of the bar and assessing the electrical grid.</p>

<p>Frequent patrons of the pub have rallied in the hopes of helping the business reopen. A GoFundMe page raised more than $67,000 in donations in two days, soaring past its original goal.</p>

<p>Cara Anastasio walked by the boarded-up windows and remembered all the times she and her fiancé had stopped by one of their favorite places.</p>


<p>Ireland’s Four Courts is where they had their first date.</p>

<p>“It’s heartbreaking because it was a community staple. They’ve been around for a long time,” she told News4. “I hope that they can rebuild, they reopen and the community comes back to support them.”</p>

<p>Cahill says his intention is to reopen.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a process. You know, today is day one, and we’re still thinking about the victims,” he said.</p>
