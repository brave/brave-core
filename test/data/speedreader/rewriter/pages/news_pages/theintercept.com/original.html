One of the most notorious signatures of this destructive process is the Pentagon’s</span> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/09/20/ndaa-military-equipment-police-1033/"><span style="font-weight: 400">1033 program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which since 1990 has distributed more than $7.4 billion in military weapons — including armored vehicles, grenade launchers, and sniper rifles — to police departments across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This deluge of military hardware among civilian populations is harmful enough, creating mini-armies inside American communities that are desperate for better schools and social services. But what’s been just as harmful, if not worse, is the military mindset instilled in police ranks after 9/11.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the most prominent and controversial police trainers these days is Dave Grossman, a retired military officer who catapulted onto the lecture circuit after writing a book titled “On Killing.” Our paths crossed in the early days of the 9/11 era, when I was working on</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/10/magazine/a-bulletproof-mind.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">a magazine story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and attended a talk he delivered in 2002 to a military audience whom he saluted at the end. It was a boilerplate speech for him, delivered hundreds if not thousands of times since, in which he talked about the ways in which soldiers should be trained to kill so they do not hesitate to pull the trigger and do not feel guilty about it afterward. Even in the military community, his theories were</span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110721211742/http:/www.journal.dnd.ca/vo9/no2/16-engen-eng.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400">controversial and disputed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by academics who believed that Grossman did not fully understand the dynamics or history of killing in wartime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grossman was primarily speaking to military audiences in those days — there was a lot of demand for people like him as the Pentagon was beefing up its ranks and starting its catastrophic wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. After a while, as fewer U.S. soldiers were deployed overseas, he transitioned to speaking to a broader range of civilian groups, especially police departments, even though his base of experience is in combat psychology. His policing lectures are grafted from his military talks, emphasizing the danger of the job and the need for split-second aggression — even though policing is hardly the</span> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/8/22/6053627/being-a-police-officer-is-dangerous-these-jobs-are-more-dangerous"><span style="font-weight: 400">most dangerous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> profession in America. (Loggers, roofers, farmers, and sanitation engineers, among other workers, have higher on-the-job fatalities.) In a 2020 story on Grossman, the writer Justin Peters</span> <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/warrior-cop-class-dave-grossman-killology.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that “there is a cottage industry of trainers and consultants who encourage police to see their beats as a battlefield” and described Grossman as likening America to “a terrifying place where police are both the primary targets of and defenders against super-predation.”</span></p></div><blockquote class="Pullquote Pullquote--left" data-reactid="199"><span class="Pullquote-line" data-reactid="200"></span><div data-reactid="201">Grossman, like Gallagher, is just a symptom of the problem.</div></blockquote><div data-reactid="202"><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an encouraging development, Grossman’s lectures to police audiences are getting criticized more frequently than before. Last year, the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police</span> <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/04/27/dave-grossman-killology-police/7391492002/"><span style="font-weight: 400">canceled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a talk by him after justice advocates noted that his observations on police killings have included</span> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/12/do-not-resist-the-police-militarization-documentary-everyone-should-see/"><span style="font-weight: 400">a remark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that law enforcement officers can have the best sex of their lives after an on-the-job shooting. (A spokesperson for Grossman, asked for comment, told The Intercept via email, &#8220;The human body processes stress and a deadly force encounter many different ways. This is one way of MANY that humans react to and process what they just went through.&#8221;) A recent story by the Washington Post</span> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/11/police-training-warrior-mindset-killology/"><span style="font-weight: 400">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that the sorts of workshops conducted by Grossman and others were cited in a lawsuit over a police killing in Spokane Valley, Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet Grossman, like Gallagher, is just a symptom of the problem. Even as the Tallahassee Police Department was trying to back away from its connection to an accused war criminal who has become a right-wing rock star in the fashion of </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/11/19/kyle-rittenhouse-walks-free-republican-lawmakers-fight-loves/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyle Rittenhouse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, local journalists</span> <a href="https://ourtallahassee.com/tallahassee-police-department-recruitment-video-raises-concern-in-community/"><span style="font-weight: 400">unearthed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a recruitment video from the department that highlighted an array of military-grade equipment and tactics used by its officers. The video showed off an armored personnel carrier, a camouflage-covered sniper, a squad of riot police marching in a V formation, and an armored bulldozer called the “</span><a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2020/11/12/tallahassee-police-rook-armored-vehicle-has-tactical-regional-emergency-purposes/6265685002/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.” But don’t blame the TPD for being over-the-top: The gear in its video is standard in police departments across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fundamental problem, which was generations in the making and will perhaps be generations in the solving, is the internalization of a military force and a military ideology that were ostensibly built for external purposes. This is the forever wars coming home. The problem is not just that military spending since 9/11 has helped impoverish America while destroying foreign countries in illegal wars that cost trillions of dollars and left</span> <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human"><span style="font-weight: 400">a million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> or more people dead (mostly foreigners, but plenty of Americans too). History has shown that the aftermath of foreign wars is not what you might expect. “War is not neatly contained in the space and time legitimated by the state,” noted Kathleen Belew in “<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674286078">Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America</a>.” She added, “It reverberates in other terrains and lasts long past armistice. It comes home in ways bloody and unexpected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And we have just seen one of those ways: Eddie Gallagher giving shooting tips to cops.</span></p>
