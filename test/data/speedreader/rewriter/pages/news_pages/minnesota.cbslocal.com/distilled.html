<p><strong>MINNESOTA FAIRGROUNDS, Minn.</strong> -- In a little over a week, millions will begin to pack the state fairgrounds for the Minnesota State Fair. Organizers estimate crowd sizes will be similar to 2019, pre-pandemic. That year, more than two million people visited the fair during the 12 days.</p><p>But staffing for security hasn't come easy this year following the Ramsey County Board of Supervisors decision to not renew a partnership between the fair and the Ramsey County Sheriff's Office. Instead, the State Fair reinstated its police department.</p><p>In a letter sent to the Ramsey County on August 4, organizers expressed concern they may not be able to fulfill the needed 200 officers in time for the fair. In response, the Ramsey County Sheriff's Office has agreed to provide up to 40 deputies a day and active shooter response teams. Additional state troopers will be positioned at entrances. &nbsp;</p><figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"><span class="img embed__content"><img alt="6p-pkg-state-fair-secur-wcco1uav.jpg " class=" lazyload" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/15/f7330f2e-d7b8-4fd6-bb90-2d1ea937ca40/thumbnail/620x349/47bf8200ed57a37bbc8ece6d88e98fe0/6p-pkg-state-fair-secur-wcco1uav.jpg 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/15/f7330f2e-d7b8-4fd6-bb90-2d1ea937ca40/thumbnail/1240x698/2b045dc0f640ef6f52862b83bdb42821/6p-pkg-state-fair-secur-wcco1uav.jpg 2x" height="349" src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/15/f7330f2e-d7b8-4fd6-bb90-2d1ea937ca40/thumbnail/620x349/47bf8200ed57a37bbc8ece6d88e98fe0/6p-pkg-state-fair-secur-wcco1uav.jpg#" srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/15/f7330f2e-d7b8-4fd6-bb90-2d1ea937ca40/thumbnail/620x349/47bf8200ed57a37bbc8ece6d88e98fe0/6p-pkg-state-fair-secur-wcco1uav.jpg 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/08/15/f7330f2e-d7b8-4fd6-bb90-2d1ea937ca40/thumbnail/1240x698/2b045dc0f640ef6f52862b83bdb42821/6p-pkg-state-fair-secur-wcco1uav.jpg 2x" width="620"></span>
