"Things have changed so much in such a short time — within weeks, the COVID lockdown happened.”</p><figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"><img alt="Fellow artist and friend Saffell Gardner, left, congratulates Scott Hocking after the unveiling of Hocking's sculpture &quot;Floating Citadel&quot; on Wednesday Aug. 17, 2022 in front of Huntington Place." class="gnt_em_img_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/08/18/PDTF/0a9e1e25-30c2-452a-9ec7-1abfc43e4fb4-ScottHocking_081722_01_MW.jpg?width=660&amp;height=441&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/08/18/PDTF/0a9e1e25-30c2-452a-9ec7-1abfc43e4fb4-ScottHocking_081722_01_MW.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=882&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/08/18/PDTF/0a9e1e25-30c2-452a-9ec7-1abfc43e4fb4-ScottHocking_081722_01_MW.jpg?width=660&amp;height=441&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/08/18/PDTF/0a9e1e25-30c2-452a-9ec7-1abfc43e4fb4-ScottHocking_081722_01_MW.jpg?width=1320&amp;height=882&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp 2x"></figure><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The artist tapped into his love of history for inspiration in designing the sculpture, and referenced the Detroit River and its shoreline just beyond the walls of Huntington Place.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“I love the history of Detroit,” he said. “I love digging through those layers of what was here before, and what it means to put something here now. We’re within the original borders and fortifications of the city of Detroit when it was just a village, and right behind me was the Citadel. The Citadel was like the defensive core of this village … (which) led to making this piece that feels like this kind of protective, strong piece.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“It’s made out of bronze, which is 90% copper. My ancestry were Cornish copper miners from the U.P.; the copper came down the waterway to make all the industry in Detroit. All those things factor in. I want to thank the city of Detroit. It’s been a constant inspiration my whole life—that’s why I’m still here.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The unveiling comes as Huntington Place prepares to host&nbsp;the North American International Auto Show, which opens to the public Saturday, Sept. 17&nbsp;and runs through Sept. 25.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p"><strong>Related:&nbsp;</strong><a class="gnt_ar_b_a" data-t-l=":b|e|inline click|${u}" href="/story/money/cars/mark-phelan/2022/07/09/detroit-auto-show-naias-concours-delegance/10008799002/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Auto show, Concours d’Elegance team up for September weekend showcasing Detroit</a></p></div></article></main></body>
