<p>The city council Tuesday night is expected to approve the first reading of an ordinance that would make it illegal to climb, jump or dive off any bridge or structure over a channel of public water in the city.</p>
<p>The rule is meant to stop people from jumping off the historic Stillwater Lift Bridge into the St. Croix River, said Police Chief Brian Mueller.</p>
<p>Bridge tenders who work for the Minnesota Department of Transportation approached city officials earlier this summer and asked them to consider the ordinance. “I thought it was already illegal, to be honest,” Mueller said.</p>	
<p>Jumping from the bridge could be dangerous, “depending on how high or low the water is,” Mueller said. There are boats going under the bridge, there’s debris in the water and the river often has a strong current, he said.</p>
<p>“Kids might think it’s a really fun idea, and we’re just worried about their safety,” he said. “We don’t want anyone to get hurt.”</p>

<p>Exceptions to the ordinance would be allowed for authorized workers, public-safety purposes or activities sanctioned by the city or other government entity.</p>
<p>Violators could face a petty misdemeanor, which is a payable ticket with a maximum $300 fine, said City Attorney Korine Land.</p>
<p>The ordinance could become law following a second reading and affirmative city council vote on Sept. 5.</p>	
<p>Adam Josephson, east area manager for MnDOT, said crews will post a sign on the bridge alerting people to the ordinance. Similar signs are posted on the new St. Croix River bridge in Oak Park Heights, he said.</p>
<p>“It’s an unsafe activity,” he said. “We are concerned about people in the river, as well as those who are jumping off the bridge. …. We want to make sure that if it does happen, we can have the police respond to it.”</p>
<p>Stillwater Mayor Ted Kozlowski said he thinks the ordinance is “probably a good idea. I always thought it was illegal anyways.”</p>
<p>Asked how many times he had jumped from the bridge, Kozlowski responded: “No comment.”</p>
