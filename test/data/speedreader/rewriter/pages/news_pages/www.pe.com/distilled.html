</div><div><div><p>A shooting in a Perris neighborhood left one man dead and two others injured early Sunday, Aug. 14.</p>
<p>Callers hearing gunshots in a residential area near Saddleback Way and Pillar Court summoned deputies at about 12:22 a.m., said Riverside County Sheriff’s Sgt. Brandi Swan. First-responders located one wounded man and attempted to revive him, but he died at the scene.</p>
<p>Another two gunshot victims were driven to nearby hospitals, Swan said. Investigators believe they were wounded in the shooting. They were expected to survive.</p>

<p>No arrest had been announced as of Sunday afternoon. A description of any possible suspect or motive for the shooting was not immediately released.</p>
