Each subdirectory in this folder is a Chrome user data directory [0] populated
with test data for testing the Chrome profile importer.

The files in each test user data directory were created via the following
process:

1. Create a new profile in Chrome.
2. Simulate browsing activity (visit sites, save bookmarks, passwords, etc.).
3. Copy relevant files from the the new profile's user data directory to the
   test user data directory.

If special care was taken to generate a certain type of test data, the process
should be documented below.

# Login Data

## Using the mock keychain

Some of the fields in the Login Data SQLite db, such as saved passwords, are
encrypted by Chrome's OSCrypt class. To test them reliably, Chrome was
launched with the `--use-mock-keychain` argument for the session where the
test login data was simulated:

    /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --use-mock-keychain

When `--use-mock- keychain` is enabled, a fixed key is used to encrypt all
data that is encrypted with OSCrypt. We may then enable the mock keychain
during tests so the corresponding decryption will use the same fixed key.

## Triggering a password save prompt in Chrome

A web form submission must meet several criteria in order for it to cause
Chrome to prompt to save a password. To aid in creating additional test cases,
use `trigger_password_save_prompt.html`, included in this directory. To use,
serve on a local web server and navigate your test Chrome profile to the
corresponding address. For example, you could run Python 3's built-in
`http.server` in the same directory:

    python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind 127.0.0.1

Then navigate to `127.0.0.1:8080/trigger_password_save_prompt.html` in Chrome.
Enter any username and password, and click `Submit`. You should be prompted to
save the password.

I recommend using a different port number to easily distinguish each test case.

# Cookies

Start Chrome with a test profile. Make sure to `--use-mock-keychain` if you
want to be able to test the decrypted value of the cookie.

Run `node cookies_server.js` and navigate to http://localhost:8080 in a test
Chrome profile to have a test cookie set on localhost.
