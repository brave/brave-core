# Since recent changes upstream, Chromium is now using IDs up to ~59570 (see end
# of //out/<BUILD_TYPE>/gen/tools/gritsettings/default_resource_ids). We
# previously added our strings after all of the upstream strings, but we are now
# too close to the maximum id (65536) to continue doing that. Instead, we now
# overlap with a section of upstream strings related to ChromeOS/Ash which are
# unused by us. This range currently runs from [31600-40000), so it should
# provide a decent amount of room for future growth.
