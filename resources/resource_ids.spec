# Since recent changes upstream, Chromium is now using IDs up to ~59570 (see end
# of //out/Component/gen/tools/gritsettings/default_resource_ids). We previously
# added our strings after all of the upstream strings, but we are now too close
# to the maximum id (65536) to continue doing that. Instead, we now overlap with
# a section of upstream strings related to ChromeOS/Ash which are unused by us.
# This range runs from 29300-36930, so it should provide a decent amount of
# room for future growth.
