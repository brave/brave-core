# This file lists all dependencies used from first-party code. It should not
# include transitive dependencies, as those will be determined from Cargo.
#
# All versions should be specified as a version epoch (a single non-zero version
# component such as "2" or "0.3").
#   e.g.
#   santas-workshop = "2"
#
# Any features used by first-party code must be declared here in order to ensure
# they are included in the crate when it is built.
#   e.g.
#   santas-workshop = { version = "3", features = [ "candycanes" ] }
#
# We have some extensions in order to provide additional info for the BUILD.gn
# files that can't be derived from Cargo. Any extension should be added to
# the dependency crate's set of properties.
#   e.g.
#   santas-workshop = { version = "3", some-extension = true }
#
# Extensions:
#
# allow-first-party-usage: If false, the crate should not be visible to first
#   party code even though it is present in this file. It defaults to true. Use
#   this if you need to declare extensions for a crate that is only meant for
#   use as a transitive dependency of third-party crates.
#   e.g. allow-first-party-usage = false
#
# build-script-outputs: A list of file paths, rooted from where the BUILD.gn
#   file is located, of files generated by the crate's build script.
#   e.g. build-script-outputs = [ "crate/src/gen/gen_stuff.rs" ]

# Crates listed in dependencies will have a :lib GN target built for them in
# their BUILD.gn file. The :lib target can be depended on from Chromium
# production and test code. Third-party crates that are not listed in this
# file are not visible to Chromium code.

# Since cxx-gen is used as a standalone binary, rather than as a library, we
# can't depend on it in the usual way. Add it as a workspace member so cargo can
# resolve its dependencies.
