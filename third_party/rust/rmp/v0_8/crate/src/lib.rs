//! # The Rust MessagePack Library
//!
//! RMP is a pure Rust [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org) implementation of an efficient binary
//! serialization format. This crate provides low-level core functionality, writers and readers for
//! primitive values with direct mapping between binary MessagePack format.
//!
//! **Warning** this library is still in rapid development and everything may change until 1.0
//! comes.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! To use `rmp`, first add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.rmp]
//! rmp = "^0.8"
//! ```
//!
//! Then, add this line to your crate root:
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate rmp;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Convenient API**
//!
//!   RMP is designed to be lightweight and straightforward. There are low-level API, which gives you
//!   full control on data encoding/decoding process and makes no heap allocations. On the other hand
//!   there are high-level API, which provides you convenient interface using Rust standard library and
//!   compiler reflection, allowing to encode/decode structures using `derive` attribute.
//!
//! - **Zero-copy value decoding**
//!
//!   RMP allows to decode bytes from a buffer in a zero-copy manner easily and blazingly fast, while Rust
//!   static checks guarantees that the data will be valid until buffer lives.
//!
//! - **Clear error handling**
//!
//!   RMP's error system guarantees that you never receive an error enum with unreachable variant.
//!
//! - **Robust and tested**
//!
//!   This project is developed using TDD and CI, so any found bugs will be fixed without breaking
//!   existing functionality.
//!
//! ## Detailed
//!
//! This crate represents the very basic functionality needed to work with MessagePack format.
//! Ideologically it is developed as a basis for building high-level abstractions.
//!
//! Currently there are two large modules: encode and decode. More detail you can find in the
//! corresponding sections.
//!
//! Formally every MessagePack message consists of some marker encapsulating a data type and the
//! data itself. Sometimes there are no separate data chunk, for example for booleans. In these
//! cases a marker contains the value. For example, the `true` value is encoded as `0xc3`.
//!
//! ```
//! let mut buf = Vec::new();
//! rmp::encode::write_bool(&mut buf, true).unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!([0xc3], buf[..]);
//! ```
//!
//! Sometimes a single value can be encoded in multiple ways. For example a value of `42` can be
//! represented as: `[0x2a], [0xcc, 0x2a], [0xcd, 0x00, 0x2a]` and so on, and all of them are
//! considered as valid representations. To allow fine-grained control over encoding such values
//! the library provides direct mapping functions.
//!
//! ```
//! let mut bufs = vec![vec![]; 5];
//!
//! rmp::encode::write_pfix(&mut bufs[0], 42).unwrap();
//! rmp::encode::write_u8(&mut bufs[1], 42).unwrap();
//! rmp::encode::write_u16(&mut bufs[2], 42).unwrap();
//! rmp::encode::write_u32(&mut bufs[3], 42).unwrap();
//! rmp::encode::write_u64(&mut bufs[4], 42).unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!([0x2a], bufs[0][..]);
//! assert_eq!([0xcc, 0x2a], bufs[1][..]);
//! assert_eq!([0xcd, 0x00, 0x2a], bufs[2][..]);
//! assert_eq!([0xce, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x2a], bufs[3][..]);
//! assert_eq!([0xcf, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x2a], bufs[4][..]);
//! ```
//!
//! But they aren't planned to be widely used. Instead we often need to encode bytes compactly to
//! save space. In these cases RMP provides functions that guarantee that for encoding the most
//! compact representation will be chosen.
//!
//! ```
//! let mut buf = Vec::new();
//!
//! rmp::encode::write_sint(&mut buf, 300).unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!([0xcd, 0x1, 0x2c], buf[..]);
//! ```
//!
//! On the other hand for deserialization it is not matter in which representation the value is
//! encoded - RMP deals with all of them.
//!
//! Sometimes you know the exact type representation and want to enforce the deserialization process
//! to make it strongly type safe.
//!
//! ```
//! let buf = [0xcd, 0x1, 0x2c];
//!
//! assert_eq!(300, rmp::decode::read_u16(&mut &buf[..]).unwrap());
//! ```
//!
//! However if you try to decode such bytearray as other integer type, for example `u32`, there will
//! be type mismatch error.
//!
//! ```
//! let buf = [0xcd, 0x1, 0x2c];
//! rmp::decode::read_u32(&mut &buf[..]).err().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! But sometimes all you want is just to encode an integer that *must* fit in the specified type
//! no matter how it was encoded. RMP provides [`such`][read_int] function to ease integration with
//! other MessagePack libraries.
//!
//! ```
//! let buf = [0xcd, 0x1, 0x2c];
//!
//! assert_eq!(300i16, rmp::decode::read_int(&mut &buf[..]).unwrap());
//! assert_eq!(300i32, rmp::decode::read_int(&mut &buf[..]).unwrap());
//! assert_eq!(300i64, rmp::decode::read_int(&mut &buf[..]).unwrap());
//! assert_eq!(300u16, rmp::decode::read_int(&mut &buf[..]).unwrap());
//! assert_eq!(300u32, rmp::decode::read_int(&mut &buf[..]).unwrap());
//! assert_eq!(300u64, rmp::decode::read_int(&mut &buf[..]).unwrap());
//! ```
//!
//! ## API
//!
//! Almost all API are represented as pure functions, which accepts a generic `Write` or `Read` and
//! the value to be encoded/decoded. For example let's do a round trip for Ï€ number.
//!
//! ```
//! let pi = std::f64::consts::PI;
//! let mut buf = Vec::new();
//! rmp::encode::write_f64(&mut buf, pi).unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!([0xcb, 0x40, 0x9, 0x21, 0xfb, 0x54, 0x44, 0x2d, 0x18], buf[..]);
//! assert_eq!(pi, rmp::decode::read_f64(&mut &buf[..]).unwrap());
//! ```
//!
