# 0.3.0

* Use black_box instead of volatile read when inline assembly is not
  available.
* Increase minimum Rust version to 1.66, which is when black_box was
  stabilized.

# 0.2.6

* New tests using the count_instructions crate; no functional changes.

# 0.2.5

* Add #[must_use] to all functions.

# 0.2.4

* Since CC0 is no longer accepted as a license for code by Fedora, also
  allow MIT-0 or Apache-2.0 as options. No code changes.

# 0.2.3

* Add fixed-size variant for arrays of any size (using const generics).

# 0.2.2

* Set rust-version in Cargo.toml to 1.59.

# 0.2.1

* Reduce inlining of variable-size variant. In 0.1.5, the loop was not
  inlined, and it can be a bit large due to the auto-vectorization. Go
  back to how it was in 0.1.5, but allowing the compiler to inline if
  it believes it would be a speed gain.

# 0.2.0

* Use inline assembly when available to hide from the optimizer.
* When inline assembly is not available, use both a volatile read and
  disabled inlining.
* Increase minimum Rust version to 1.59, which is the first with inline
  assembly.

# 0.1.5

* Add fixed-size variant for arrays with sizes 16 bytes, 32 bytes, and
  64 bytes.
