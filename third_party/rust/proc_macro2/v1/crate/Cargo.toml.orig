[patch.crates-io]
# Our doc tests depend on quote which depends on proc-macro2. Without this line,
# the proc-macro2 dependency of quote would be the released version of
# proc-macro2. Quote would implement its traits for types from that proc-macro2,
# meaning impls would be missing when tested against types from the local
# proc-macro2.
#
# GitHub Actions builds that are in progress at the time that you publish may
# spuriously fail. This is because they'll be building a local proc-macro2 which
# carries the second-most-recent version number, pulling in quote which resolves
# to a dependency on the just-published most recent version number. Thus the
# patch will fail to apply because the version numbers are different.
