JSON is simpler to read and write, and it’s less prone to bugs.</p>\n<p>So we developed JSON Feed, a format similar to <a href=\"http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS</a> and <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287\">Atom</a> but in JSON. It reflects the lessons learned from our years of work reading and publishing feeds.</p>..."
