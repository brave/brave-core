/// In this section, we will use `Ptr<T, V>` as a shorthand for `Ptr<T, I:
/// Invariants<Validity = V>>` for brevity.
///
/// Each `V: Validity` defines a set of bit values which may appear in the
/// referent of a `Ptr<T, V>`, denoted `S(T, V)`. Each `V: Validity`, in its
/// documentation, provides a definition of `S(T, V)` which must be valid for
/// all `T: ?Sized`. Any `V: Validity` must guarantee that this set is only a
/// function of the *bit validity* of the referent type, `T`, and not of any
/// other property of `T`. As a consequence, given `V: Validity`, `T`, and `U`
/// where `T` and `U` have the same bit validity, `S(V, T) = S(V, U)`.
///
/// It is guaranteed that the referent of any `ptr: Ptr<T, V>` is a member of
/// `S(T, V)`. Unsafe code must ensure that this guarantee will be upheld for
/// any existing `Ptr`s or any `Ptr`s that that code creates.
///
/// An important implication of this guarantee is that it restricts what
/// transmutes are sound, where "transmute" is used in this context to refer to
/// changing the referent type or validity invariant of a `Ptr`, as either
/// change may change the set of bit values permitted to appear in the referent.
/// In particular, the following are necessary (but not sufficient) conditions
/// in order for a transmute from `src: Ptr<T, V>` to `dst: Ptr<U, W>` to be
/// sound:
/// - If `S(T, V) = S(U, W)`, then no restrictions apply; otherwise,
/// - If `dst` permits mutation of its referent (e.g. via `Exclusive` aliasing
///   or interior mutation under `Shared` aliasing), then it must hold that
///   `S(T, V) ⊇ S(U, W)` - in other words, the transmute must not expand the
///   set of allowed referent bit patterns. A violation of this requirement
///   would permit using `dst` to write `x` where `x ∈ S(U, W)` but `x ∉ S(T,
///   V)`, which would violate the guarantee that `src`'s referent may only
///   contain values in `S(T, V)`.
/// - If the referent may be mutated without going through `dst` while `dst` is
///   live (e.g. via interior mutation on a `Shared`-aliased `Ptr` or `&`
///   reference), then it must hold that `S(T, V) ⊆ S(U, W)` - in other words,
///   the transmute must not shrink the set of allowed referent bit patterns. A
///   violation of this requirement would permit using `src` or another
///   mechanism (e.g. a `&` reference used to derive `src`) to write `x` where
///   `x ∈ S(T, V)` but `x ∉ S(U, W)`, which would violate the guarantee that
///   `dst`'s referent may only contain values in `S(U, W)`.
