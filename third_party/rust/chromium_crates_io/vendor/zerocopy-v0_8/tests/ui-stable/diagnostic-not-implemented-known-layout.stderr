error[E0277]: the trait bound `NotZerocopy: zerocopy::KnownLayout` is not satisfied

   |                          ^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `zerocopy::KnownLayout` is not implemented for `NotZerocopy`
   |
   = note: Consider adding `#[derive(KnownLayout)]` to `NotZerocopy`
   = help: the following other types implement trait `zerocopy::KnownLayout`:
             &T
             &mut T
             ()
             *const T
             *mut T
             AU16
             AtomicBool
             AtomicI16
           and $N others
note: required by a bound in `takes_known_layout`
