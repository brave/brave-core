# Note on license change

The licensing of this crate changed from the Bootstrap Open Source License
to the above "MIT OR Apache-2.0" dual license in release 0.7.0. The license
exception that applied to the Zcash and Zebra projects, other projects
designed to integrate with Zcash, and certain forks of Zcash, is no longer
necessary. For clarity, this is intended to be a strict relaxation of the
previous licensing, i.e. it permits all usage that was previously possible
with or without use of the license exception.
