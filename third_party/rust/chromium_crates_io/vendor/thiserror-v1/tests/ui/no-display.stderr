error[E0599]: the method `as_display` exists for reference `&NoDisplay`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied
 --> tests/ui/no-display.rs:7:9

4 | struct NoDisplay;
  | ---------------- doesn't satisfy `NoDisplay: std::fmt::Display`
...
7 | #[error("thread: {thread}")]
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ method cannot be called on `&NoDisplay` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
  |
  = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `NoDisplay: std::fmt::Display`
          which is required by `&NoDisplay: AsDisplay<'_>`
note: the trait `std::fmt::Display` must be implemented
 --> $RUST/core/src/fmt/mod.rs
  |
  | pub trait Display {
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
  = note: the following trait defines an item `as_display`, perhaps you need to implement it:
          candidate #1: `AsDisplay`
