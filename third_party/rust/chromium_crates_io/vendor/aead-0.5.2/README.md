This crate provides an abstract interface for [AEAD] ciphers, which guarantee
both confidentiality and integrity, even from a powerful attacker who is
able to execute [chosen-ciphertext attacks]. The resulting security property,
[ciphertext indistinguishability], is considered a basic requirement for
modern cryptographic implementations.

See [RustCrypto/AEADs] for cipher implementations which use this trait.
