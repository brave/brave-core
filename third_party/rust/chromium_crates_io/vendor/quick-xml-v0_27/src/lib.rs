//! High performance XML reader/writer.
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! quick-xml contains two modes of operation:
//!
//! A streaming API based on the [StAX] model. This is suited for larger XML documents which
//! cannot completely read into memory at once.
//!
//! The user has to explicitly _ask_ for the next XML event, similar to a database cursor.
//! This is achieved by the following two structs:
//!
//! - [`Reader`]: A low level XML pull-reader where buffer allocation/clearing is left to user.
//! - [`Writer`]: A XML writer. Can be nested with readers if you want to transform XMLs.
//!
//! Especially for nested XML elements, the user must keep track _where_ (how deep)
//! in the XML document the current event is located.
//!
//! quick-xml contains optional support of asynchronous reading using [tokio].
//!
//! Furthermore, quick-xml also contains optional [Serde] support to directly
//! serialize and deserialize from structs, without having to deal with the XML events.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! - For a reading example see [`Reader`]
//! - For a writing example see [`Writer`]
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! `quick-xml` supports the following features:
//!
//! [StAX]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StAX
//! [tokio]: https://tokio.rs/
//! [Serde]: https://serde.rs/
