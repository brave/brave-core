# This is a hack in order to make the rustdoc tests and releases happy.
# We include README in the library docs, this way the are run as tests. Those examples create a
# circular dependency on `ipld-core` (as `serde_ipld_dagcbor` and `serde_ipld_dagjson` depend on
# `ipld-core`.
# Also without this change `cargo release` would complain, as the `Cargo.lock` needs modifications
# as the previously mentioned crates would need to depend on an already released and not the about
# to be released version of `ipld-core`.
