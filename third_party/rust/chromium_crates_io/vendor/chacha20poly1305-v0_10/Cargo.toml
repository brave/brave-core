Pure Rust implementation of the ChaCha20Poly1305 Authenticated Encryption
with Additional Data Cipher (RFC 8439) with optional architecture-specific
hardware acceleration. Also contains implementations of the XChaCha20Poly1305
extended nonce variant of ChaCha20Poly1305, and the reduced-round
ChaCha8Poly1305 and ChaCha12Poly1305 lightweight variants.
