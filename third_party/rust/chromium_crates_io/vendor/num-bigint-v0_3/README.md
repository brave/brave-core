Big integer types for Rust, `BigInt` and `BigUint`.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
num-bigint = "0.3"
```

## Features

The `std` crate feature is enabled by default, and is mandatory before Rust
1.36 and the stabilized `alloc` crate.  If you depend on `num-bigint` with
`default-features = false`, you must manually enable the `std` feature yourself
if your compiler is not new enough.

### Random Generation

`num-bigint` supports the generation of random big integers when the `rand`
feature is enabled. To enable it include rand as

```toml
rand = "0.7"
num-bigint = { version = "0.3", features = ["rand"] }
```

Note that you must use the version of `rand` that `num-bigint` is compatible
with: `0.7`.

## Releases

Release notes are available in [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md).

## Compatibility

The `num-bigint` crate is tested for rustc 1.31 and greater.

## Alternatives

While `num-bigint` strives for good performance in pure Rust code, other
crates may offer better performance with different trade-offs.  The following
table offers a brief comparison to a few alternatives.
