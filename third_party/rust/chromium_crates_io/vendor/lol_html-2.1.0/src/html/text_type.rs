/// A type of parsed text.

/// Parsing context adds certain limitations for the textual content. E.g., it's unsafe to
/// rewrite text inside `<script>` element with a string that contains `"</script>"` substring as
/// this will preemptively close the `<script>` element, possibly introducing an XSS attack vector.
/// As other example, some parsing contexts don't allow [HTML entities] in text. Thus, rewriting
/// content of a `<style>` element with text that contains HTML entities may cause a CSS parsing
/// error in a browser, because entities won't be decoded by a browser in this context.
///
/// Text type provides users of the rewriter with a capability to assess the context in which text
/// parsing is hapenning and make informed decision about preprocessing of the textual content
/// replacement.
///
/// The names of the text types are taken from the [HTML parsing specification].
