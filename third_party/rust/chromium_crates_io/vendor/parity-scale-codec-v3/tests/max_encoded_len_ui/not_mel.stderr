error[E0599]: the function or associated item `max_encoded_len` exists for struct `Generic<NotMel>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

4  | struct NotMel;
   | ------------- doesn't satisfy `NotMel: MaxEncodedLen`

   | ----------------- function or associated item `max_encoded_len` not found for this struct because it doesn't satisfy `Generic<NotMel>: MaxEncodedLen`

12 |     let _ = Generic::<NotMel>::max_encoded_len();
   |                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ function or associated item cannot be called on `Generic<NotMel>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
   |
   = note: trait bound `NotMel: MaxEncodedLen` was not satisfied
note: the trait `MaxEncodedLen` must be implemented
  --> src/max_encoded_len.rs
   |
   | pub trait MaxEncodedLen: Encode {
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `max_encoded_len`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `MaxEncodedLen`
