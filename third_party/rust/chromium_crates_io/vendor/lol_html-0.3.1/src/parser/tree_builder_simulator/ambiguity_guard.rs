//! There are few ambigious cases where we can't determine correct
//! parsing context having a limited information about the current
//! state of tree builder. This caused issues in the past where
//! Cloudflare's security features were used as XSS gadgets
//! (see <https://portswigger.net/blog/when-security-features-collide>).
//! Therefore, due to these safety concerns in such cases we prefer
//! to bail out from tokenization process.
//!
//! In tree builder simulation we need to switch parser to one
//! of standalone text parsing state machines if we encounter some
//! specific tags. E.g. if we encounter `<script>` start tag we should
//! treat all content up to the closing `</script>` tag as text.
//! Without having a full-featured tree construction stage there is way
//! to trick parser into parsing content that has actual tags in it
//! as text. E.g. by putting `<script>` start tag into context where
//! it will be ignored.
//!
//! There are just a few tree builder insertion modes in which text
//! parsing mode switching start tags can be ignored: in `<select>` and in
//! or after `<frameset>`.
//!
//! There are numerous not so obvious ways to get into or get out of these
//! insertion modes. So, for safety reasons we try to be pro-active here
//! and just bailout in case if we see text parsing mode switching start tags
//! between `<select>` start and end tag, or anywhere after the `<frameset>`
//! start tag. These cases shouldn't trigger bailout for any *conforming*
//! markup.
//!
//! However, there is a case where bailout could happen even with conforming
//! markup: if we encounter text parsing mode switching start tag in `<template>`
//! which is inside `<select>` element content. Unfortunately, rules required
//! to track template parsing context are way to complicated in such a case
//! and will require an implementation of the significant part of the tree
//! construction state. Though, current assumption is that markup that can
//! trigger this bailout case should be seen quite rarely in the wild.

/// An error that occurs when HTML parser runs into an ambigious state in the [`strict`] mode.
///
/// Since the rewriter operates on a token stream and doesn't have access to a full
/// DOM-tree, there are certain rare cases of non-conforming HTML markup which can't be
/// guaranteed to be parsed correctly without an ability to backtrace the tree.
///
/// Therefore, due to security considerations, sometimes it's preferable to abort the
/// rewriting process in case of such uncertainty.
///
/// One of the simplest examples of such markup is the following:
///
/// ```html
/// ...
/// <select><xmp><script>"use strict";</script></select>
/// ...
/// ```
///
/// The `<xmp>` element is not allowed inside the `<select>` element, so in a browser the start
/// tag for `<xmp>` will be ignored and following `<script>` element will be parsed and executed.
///
/// On the other hand, the `<select>` element itself can be also ignored depending on the
/// context in which it was parsed. In this case, the `<xmp>` element will not be ignored
/// and the `<script>` element along with its content will be parsed as a simple text inside
/// it.
///
/// So, in this case the parser needs an ability to backtrace the DOM-tree to figure out the
/// correct parsing context.
