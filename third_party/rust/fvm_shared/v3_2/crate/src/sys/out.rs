//! This module contains syscall output data carrier structs, shared between
//! the FVM SDK and the FVM itself, wrapping multi-value returns.
//!
//! These are necessary because Rust WASM multi-value return compilation is
//! plagued with issues and catch-22 problems, making it unfeasible to use
//! actual bare multi-value returns in FFI extern definitions.
//!
//! Read more at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73755.

// NOTE: When possible, pack fields such that loads will be power-of-two aligned. Un-aligned loads
// _can_ be done (LLVM will generate the appropriate code) but are slower.
//
// Read up on https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html for more information.
//
// Also, please also read the docs on super::SyscallSafe before modifying any of these types.
