## Minimum Rust version policy

The time crate is guaranteed to compile with any release of rustc from the past six months.
Optional feature flags that enable interoperability with third-party crates (e.g. rand)
follow the policy of that crate if stricter.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you have an idea, it's best to float it by me before working on
it to ensure no effort is wasted. If there's already an open issue for it, knock yourself out.
Internal documentation can be viewed [here](https://time-rs.github.io/internal-api/time).

If you have any questions, feel free to use [Discussions]. Don't hesitate to ask questions â€” that's
what I'm here for!
