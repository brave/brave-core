# It would be nice to have file mac/.gitignore with entries `BraveUpdater.app/`
# and `.url`. But the `DownloadAndUnpack` function we are using deletes the
# destination directory, `mac/`, and thus also `mac/.gitignore`. We therefore
# maintain the .gitignore entries here:
mac/BraveUpdater.app/
mac/.url
